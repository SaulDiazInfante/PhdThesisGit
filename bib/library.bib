abstract = {The recent article [2] reveals the strong convergence of the Euler-Maruyama solution to the exact solution of a stochastic differential equation under the local Lipschitz condition. However, it does not provide us with an order of convergence. In this note, we will show the rate of convergence still under the local Lipschitz condition, but the local Lipschitz constants of the drift coefficient, valid on balls of radius R, are supposed not to grow faster than log R while those of the diffusion coefficient are not than.},

@article{Platen2008a,
abstract = {When simulating discrete time approximations of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), numerical stability is clearly more important than numerical efficiency or some higher order of convergence. Discrete time approximations of solutions of SDEs are widely used in simulations in finance and other areas of application. The stability criterion presented is designed to handle both scenario simulation and Monte Carlo simulation, that is, strong and weak simulation methods. The symmetric predictor-corrector Euler method is shown to have the potential to overcome some of the numerical instabilities that may be experienced when using the explicit Euler method. This is of particular importance in finance, where martingale dynamics arise for solutions of SDEs and diffusion coefficients are often of multiplicative type. Stability regions for a range of schemes are visualized and discussed. For Monte Carlo simulation it turns out that schemes, which have implicitness in both the drift and the diffusion terms, exhibit the largest stability regions. It will be shown that refining the time step size in a Monte Carlo simulation can lead to numerical instabilities.},

@misc{Burrage1999,
abstract = {In recent years considerable attention has been paid to the numerical solution of stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs), as SODEs are often more appropriate than their deterministic counterparts in many modelling situations. However, unlike the deterministic case numerical methods for SODEs are considerably less sophisticated due to the difficulty in representing the (possibly large number of) random variable approximations to the stochastic integrals. Although Burrage and Burrage [High strong order explicit Runge–Kutta methods for stochastic ordinary differential equations, Applied Numerical Mathematics 22 (1996) 81–101] were able to construct strong local order 1.5 stochastic Runge–Kutta methods for certain cases, it is known that all extant stochastic Runge–Kutta methods suffer an order reduction down to strong order 0.5 if there is non-commutativity between the functions associated with the multiple Wiener processes. This order reduction down to that of the Euler–Maruyama method imposes severe difficulties in obtaining meaningful solutions in a reasonable time frame and this paper attempts to circumvent these difficulties by some new techniques. An additional difficulty in solving SODEs arises even in the linear case since it is not possible to write the solution analytically in terms of matrix exponentials unless there is a commutativity property between the functions associated with the multiple Wiener processes. Thus in this present paper first the work of Magnus [On the exponential solution of differential equations for a linear operator, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics 7 (1954) 649–673] (applied to deterministic non-commutative linear problems) will be applied to non-commutative linear SODEs and methods of strong order 1.5 for arbitrary, linear, non-commutative SODE systems will be constructed – hence giving an accurate approximation to the general linear problem. Secondly, for general nonlinear non-commutative systems with an arbitrary number (d) of Wiener processes it is shown that strong local order 1 Runge–Kutta methods with d+1 stages can be constructed by evaluated a set of Lie brackets as well as the standard function evaluations. A method is then constructed which can be efficiently implemented in a parallel environment for this arbitrary number of Wiener processes. Finally some numerical results are presented which illustrate the efficacy of these approaches.},

abstract = {Mathematical modeling combined with experimental measurements have yielded important insights into HIV-1 pathogenesis. For example, data from experiments in which HIV-infected patients are given potent antiretroviral drugs that perturb the infection process have been used to estimate kinetic parameters underlying HIV infection. Many of the models used to analyze data have assumed drug treatments to be completely efficacious and that upon infection a cell instantly begins producing virus. We consider a model that allows for less then perfect drug effects and which includes a delay in the initiation of virus production. We present detailed analysis of this delay differential equation model and compare the results to a model without delay. Our analysis shows that when drug efficacy is less than 100{\%}, as may be the case in vivo, the predicted rate of decline in plasma virus concentration depends on three factors: the death rate of virus producing cells, the efficacy of therapy, and the length of the delay. Thus, previous estimates of infected cell loss rates can be improved upon by considering more realistic models of viral infection. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.},

abstract = {Many stochastic differential equations that occur in financial modelling do not satisfy the standard assumptions made in convergence proofs of numerical schemes that are given in textbooks, i.e., their coefficients and the corresponding derivatives appearing in the proofs are not uniformly bounded and hence, in particular, not globally Lipschitz. Specific examples are the Heston and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient functions. Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless, new convergence results have been obtained recently for many such models in financial mathematics. These are reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be considered along with methods which preserve the positivity of the solutions.},

@article{Rodrigues2014,
abstract = {The relationship between epidemiology, mathematical modeling and computational tools allows to build and test theories on the development and battling of a disease. This PhD thesis is motivated by the study of epidemiological models applied to infectious diseases in an Optimal Control perspective, giving particular relevance to Dengue. Dengue is a subtropical and tropical disease transmitted by mosquitoes, that affects about 100 million people per year and is considered by the World Health Organization a major concern for public health. The mathematical models developed and tested in this work, are based on ordinary differential equations that describe the dynamics underlying the disease, including the interaction between humans and mosquitoes. An analytical study is made related to equilibrium points, their stability and basic reproduction number. The spreading of Dengue can be attenuated through measures to control the transmission vector, such as the use of specific insecticides and educational campaigns. Since the development of a potential vaccine has been a recent global bet, models based on the simulation of a hypothetical vaccination process in a population are proposed. Based on Optimal Control theory, we have analyzed the optimal strategies for using these controls, and respective impact on the reduction/eradication of the disease during an outbreak in the population, considering a bioeconomic approach. The formulated problems are numerically solved using direct and indirect methods. The first discretize the problem turning it into a nonlinear optimization problem. Indirect methods use the Pontryagin Maximum Principle as a necessary condition to find the optimal curve for the respective control. In these two strategies several numerical software packages are used.},

abstract = {On the one hand the explicit Euler scheme fails to converge strongly to the exact solution of a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with a superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficient. On the other hand the implicit Euler scheme is known to converge strongly to the exact solution of such an SDE. Implementations of the implicit Euler scheme, however, require additional computational effort. In this article we therefore propose an explicit and easily implementable numerical method for such an SDE and show that this method converges strongly with the standard order one half to the exact solution of the SDE. Simulations reveal that this explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme is considerably faster than the implicit Euler scheme.},

abstract = {Despite application of cryogen spray (CS) precooling, customary treatment of port wine stain (PWS) birthmarks with a single laser pulse does not result in complete lesion blanching for a majority of patients. One obvious reason is nonselective absorption by epidermal melanin, which limits the maximal safe radiant exposure. Another possible reason for treatment failure is screening of laser light within large PWS vessels, which prevents uniform heating of the entire vessel lumen. Our aim is to identify the parameters of sequential CS cooling and laser irradiation that will allow optimal photocoagulation of various PWS blood vessels with minimal risk of epidermal thermal damage.},

Our goal is to construct explicit numerical schemes that preserve positivity, even for super linear stochastic differential equations. It is well known that the usual Euler scheme diverges on super linear problems and the Tamed-Euler method does not preserve positivity. In that direction, we use the Semi-Discrete method that the first author has proposed in two previous papers. We propose a new numerical scheme for a class of stochastic differential equations which are super linear with non negative solution. In this class of stochastic differential equations belongs the Heston {\$}3/2{\$}-model that appears in financial mathematics, for which we prove {\%}theoretically and through numerical experiments the "optimal" order of strong convergence at least {\$}1/2{\$} of the Semi-Discrete method.},

@article{Mattingly2002a,
abstract = {The ergodic properties of SDEs, and various time discretizations for SDEs, are studied. The ergodicity of SDEs is established by using techniques from the theory of Markov chains on general state spaces, such as that expounded by Meyn-Tweedie. Application of these Markov chain results leads to straightforward proofs of geometric ergodicity for a variety of SDEs, including problems with degenerate noise and for problems with locally Lipschitz vector fields. Applications where this theory can be usefully applied include damped-driven Hamiltonian problems (the Langevin equation), the Lorenz equation with degenerate noise and gradient systems. The same Markov chain theory is then used to study time-discrete approximations of these SDEs. The two primary ingredients for ergodicity are a minorization condition and a Lyapunov condition. It is shown that the minorization condition is robust under approximation. For globally Lipschitz vector fields this is also true of the Lyapunov condition. However in the locally Lipschitz case the Lyapunov condition fails for explicit methods such as Euler-Maruyama; for pathwise approximations it is, in general, only inherited by specially constructed implicit discretizations. Examples of such discretization based on backward Euler methods are given, and approximation of the Langevin equation studied in some detail. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the existence of random periodic solutions for semilinear stochastic differential equations. We identify these as the solutions of coupled forward-backward infinite horizon stochastic integral equations in general cases. We then use the argument of the relative compactness of Wiener-Sobolev spaces in C0([0,T],L2(??)) and generalized Schauder's fixed point theorem to prove the existence of a solution of the coupled stochastic forward-backward infinite horizon integral equations. The condition on F is then further weakened by applying the coupling method of forward and backward Gronwall inequalities. The results are also valid for stationary solutions as a special case when the period ?? can be an arbitrary number. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a non-autonomous competitive phytoplankton model with periodic coefficients in deterministic and stochastic environment, respectively. We prove the existence of at least one positive periodic solution together with it’s global asymptotic stability. The existence of periodic solution has been obtained by using the continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory proposed by Gaines and Mawhin. We formulate the corresponding stochastic model by perturbing the growth rate parameters by white noise terms. We prove that all the higher order moments of the solution to the stochastic system is uniformly bounded which ensure that the solution of the stochastic system is stochastically bounded. We provide easily verifiable sufficient conditions for non-persistence in mean, extinction and stochastic permanence of the stochastic system. Sufficient condition for permanence shows that if the noise intensity is very low then the solution of the stochastic system persists in the periodic coexistence domain of the deterministic system. We perform exhaustive numerical simulations to validate our analytical findings.},

@article{Calderer2013,
abstract = {In this article, we study minimization of the Landau-de Gennes energy for liquid crystal elastomer.The total energy, is of the sum of the Lagrangian elastic stored energy function of the elastomer and the Eulerian Landau-de Gennes energy of the liquid crystal. Our model consider two sources of anisotropy represented by the traceless nematic order tensor {\$}Q{\$} (rigid units), and the positive definite step-length tensor {\$}L{\$} (network). This work is motivated by the study of cytoskeletal networks which can be regarded as consisting of rigid rod units crosslinked into a polymeric-type network. Due to the mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian structure of the energy, it is essential that the deformation maps {\$}\backslashvarphi{\$} be invertible. We require sufficient regularity of the fields {\$}(\backslashvarphi, Q){\$} of the problem, and that the deformation map satisfies the Ciarlet-Necas condition. These, in turn, determine what boundary conditions are admissible, which include the case of Dirichlet conditions on both fields. The approach of including the Rapini-Papoular surface energy for the pull-back tensor {\$}\backslashtilde Q{\$} is also discussed. The regularity requirements lead us to consider powers of the gradient of the order tensor {\$}Q{\$} higher than quadratic in the energy. We assume polyconvexity of the stored energy function with respect to the effective deformation tensor and apply methods from isotropic nonlinear elasticity. We formulate a necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee this invertibility property in terms of the growth to infinity of the bulk liquid crystal energy {\$}f(Q){\$}, as the minimum eigenvalue of {\$}Q{\$} approaches the singular limit of {\$}-\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}. {\$}L{\$} becomes singular as the minimum eigenvalue of {\$}Q{\$} reaches {\$}-\backslashfrac{\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}. Lower bounds on the eigenvalues of {\$}Q{\$} are needed to ensure compatibility between the theories of Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe of nematics (see Ball 2010).},

@article{Szekely2012,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework for improving the accuracy of fixed-step methods for Monte Carlo simulation of discrete stochastic chemical kinetics. Stochasticity is ubiquitous in many areas of cell biology, for example in gene regulation, biochemical cascades and cell-cell interaction. However most discrete stochastic simulation techniques are slow. We apply Richardson extrapolation to the moments of three fixed-step methods, the Euler, midpoint and $\theta$-trapezoidal $\tau$-leap methods, to demonstrate the power of stochastic extrapolation. The extrapolation framework can increase the order of convergence of any fixed-step discrete stochastic solver and is very easy to implement; the only condition for its use is knowledge of the appropriate terms of the global error expansion of the solver in terms of its stepsize. In practical terms, a higher-order method with a larger stepsize can achieve the same level of accuracy as a lower-order method with a smaller one, potentially reducing the computational time of the system.},

It is shown that the discretization of the drift term alone controls the A-stability of the whole scheme. The quantitative effect of implicitness upon A-stability is also investigated, and stability regions are given for a family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods with optimal order of convergence.},

Similar to deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various numerical schemes are proposed for SDEs. Stability analysis is significant for numerical SDEs as well, however a few results have been known. We have proposed the mean-square stability of numerical schemes for a scalar SDE, that is, the numeri- cal stability with respect to the mean-square norm. We studied it, however, only for scalar SDEs because of difficulty and complexity in SDE systems. Trying to make a breakthrough, in the present note we will consider a 2-dimensional linear system with one multiplicative noise and give stability criteria under several notions of the matrix norm.},

abstract = {Several Brownian numerical schemes for treating stochastic differential equations at the position Langevin level are analyzed from the point of view of their algorithmic efficiency for large-N systems. The algorithms are tested using model colloidal fluids of particles interacting via the Yukawa potential. Limitations in the conventional Brownian dynamics algorithm are shown and it is demonstrated that much better accuracy for dynamical and static quantities can be achieved with an algorithm based on the stochastic expansion and second-order stochastic Runge-Kutta algorithms. The importance of the various terms in the stochastic expansion is analyzed, and the relative merits of second-order algorithms are discussed.},

@article{Beyn2010,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the numerical approximation of stochastic ordinary differential equations, which satisfy a global monotonicity condition. This condition includes several equations with super-linearly growing drift and diffusion coefficient functions such as the stochastic Ginzburg-Landau equation and the 3/2-volatility model from mathematical finance. Our analysis of the mean-square error of convergence is based on a suitable generalization of the notions of C-stability and B-consistency known from deterministic numerical analysis for stiff ordinary differential equations. An important feature of our stability concept is that it does not rely on the availability of higher moment bounds of the numerical one-step scheme. While the convergence theorem is derived in a somewhat more abstract framework, this paper also contains two more concrete examples of stochastically C-stable numerical one-step schemes: the split-step backward Euler method from Higham et al. (2002) and a newly proposed explicit variant of the Euler-Maruyama scheme, the so called projected Euler-Maruyama method. For both methods the optimal rate of strong convergence is proven theoretically and verified in a series of numerical experiments.},

The short time behaviour of the correlation between two functions of particle position is discussed in some detail and compared with that found for a simple liquid. Finally the non-gaussian statistical properties of particle dis- placement are considered in the presence and absence of hydrodynamic interactions.},

The construction of the algorithm is based on derandomization of the Euler scheme. We provide a worst case analysis for the computational cost and the error, assuming that the coefficients of the equation have bounded derivatives up to order four and that the derivatives of f are polynomially bounded up to order four. In terms of the computational cost the error is almost of the order 23, if the diffusion coefficient is bounded away from zero, and in general we almost achieve the order 12. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We present a modified explicit Euler-Maruyama discretisation scheme that allows us to prove strong convergence, with a rate. Under some regularity and integrability conditions, we obtain the optimal strong error rate. We apply this scheme to SDEs widely used in the mathematical finance literature, including the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross{\~{}}(CIR), the 3/2 and the Ait-Sahalia models, as well as a family of mean-reverting processes with locally smooth coefficients. We numerically illustrate the strong convergence of the scheme and demonstrate its efficiency in a multilevel Monte Carlo setting.},

abstract = {Stability analysis of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is motivated by the question “for what choices of stepsize does the numerical method reproduce the characteristics of the test equation? ” We study a linear test equation with a multiplicative noise term, and consider mean-square and asymptotic stability of a stochastic version of the theta method. We extend some mean-square stability results in [Saito and Mitsui, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), pp. 2254–2267]. In particular, we show that an extension of the deterministic A-stability property holds. We also plot mean-square stability regions for the case where the test equation has real parameters. For asymptotic stability, we show that the issue reduces to finding the expected value of a parametrized random variable. We combine analytical and numerical techniques to get insights into the stability properties. For a variant of the method that has been proposed in the literature we obtain precise analytic expressions for the asymptotic stability region. This allows us to prove a number of results. The technique introduced is widely applicable, and we use it to show that a fully implicit method suggested by [Kloeden and Platen, Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, Springer-Verlag, 1992] has an asymptotic stability extension of the deterministic A-stability property. We also use the approach to explain some numerical results},

abstract = {Generating sample paths of stochastic differential equations (SDE) using the Monte Carlo method finds wide applications in financial engineering. Discretization is a popular approximate approach to generating those paths: it is easy to implement but prone to simulation bias. This article presents a new simulation scheme to exactly generate samples for SDEs. The key observation is that the law of a general SDE can be decomposed into a product of the law of standard Brownian motion and the law of a doubly stochastic Poisson process. An acceptance-rejection algorithm is devised based on the combination of this decomposition and a localization technique. The numerical results corroborates that the mean-square error of the proposed method is in the order of O(t−1/2), which is superior to the conventional discretization schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method also can generate exact samples for SDE with boundaries which the discretization schemes usually find difficulty in dealing with.},

In particular, it is not possible to derive stochastic Taylor expansions as for the solution of a SODE using an iterated application of the It$\backslash${\^{}}{\{}o{\}} formula. Consequently, until recently, only low order numerical approximation results for such a SPDE have been available. Here, the fact that the solution of a SPDE driven by additive noise can be interpreted in the mild sense with integrals involving the exponential of the dominant linear operator in the SPDE provides an alternative approach for deriving stochastic Taylor expansions for the solution of such a SPDE. Essentially, the exponential factor has a mollifying effect and ensures that all integrals take values in the Hilbert space under consideration. The iteration of such integrals allows us to derive stochastic Taylor expansions of arbitrarily high order, which are robust in the sense that they also hold for other types of driving noise processes such as fractional Brownian motion. Combinatorial concepts of trees and woods provide a compact formulation of the Taylor expansions.},

@article{Delay2005,
abstract = {Since the first attempts some 20 yr ago in the field of hydrology, random walk (RW) particle tracking as applied to solute transport has experienced profound changes. Concepts and mathematical techniques have improved to the point that numerically difficult problems (e.g., advection-dominated transport in highly heterogeneous media, or reactive transport) are now much easier to address. Random walk has never been widely used for multiphase flow, probably because numerical dispersion is not a major problem for modeling exercises at large scales. However, vadose zone hydrologic studies often point out very strong variations in fluid velocity over relatively short distances. Random walk methods may be well suited for such studies, a possibility which motivated us to write this review. We first give a comprehensive discussion of the theoretical context of the method. The Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation (FPKE) is established for solute transport, as well as the ordinary Langevin equation and its simplifications for transport of small particles (e.g., colloids). Next, numerical methods are developed for the motion of particles in space. An important section is subsequently dedicated to recent RW concepts in the time domain, and to their application to anomalous (non-Fickian) transport and inverse problems. Adaptations of RW to transport with solute-solid reactions are also provided, as well as several numerical recipes for resolving a few computational difficulties with the RW method. We purposely did not include any comparisons with Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. These approaches are discussed at length in several references cited in this review. We note, however, that today's computing capabilities provide new incentives to using RW methods for problems where Eulerian methods are potentially unstable or hampered by numerical diffusion.},

abstract = {In this paper, numerical methods for the nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with non-global Lipschitz drift coefficient are discussed. The existing known results have only so far shown that the classical (explicit) Euler-Maruyama (EM) approximate solutions converge to the true solution in probability [22,23]. More recently, the authors in [16] proved that the classical EM method will diverge in L2 sense for the underlying SDEs in this paper (and those SDEs with superlinearly growing coefficients). These strongly indicate that the classical EM method is not good enough for the highly nonlinear SDEs. However, in this paper, we introduce a modified EM method using stopping time and show successfully that the discrete version of the modified EM approximate solution converges to the true solution in the strong sense (namely in L2) with a order arbitrarily close to a half. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We describe in detail how to implement a coarse-grained hybrid Molecular Dynamics and Stochastic Rotation Dynamics simulation technique that captures the combined effects of Brownian and hydrodynamic forces in colloidal suspensions. The importance of carefully tuning the simulation parameters to correctly resolve the multiple time and length-scales of this problem is emphasized. We systematically analyze how our coarse-graining scheme resolves dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers such as the Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, the Mach number, the Knudsen number, and the Peclet number. The many Brownian and hydrodynamic time-scales can be telescoped together to maximize computational efficiency while still correctly resolving the physically relevant physical processes. We also show how to control a number of numerical artifacts, such as finite size effects and solvent induced attractive depletion interactions. When all these considerations are properly taken into account, the measured colloidal velocity auto-correlation functions and related self diffusion and friction coefficients compare quantitatively with theoretical calculations. By contrast, these calculations demonstrate that, notwithstanding its seductive simplicity, the basic Langevin equation does a remarkably poor job of capturing the decay rate of the velocity auto-correlation function in the colloidal regime, strongly underestimating it at short times and strongly overestimating it at long times. Finally, we discuss in detail how to map the parameters of our method onto physical systems, and from this extract more general lessons that may be relevant for other coarse-graining schemes such as Lattice Boltzmann or Dissipative Particle Dynamics.},

The choice of fix is found to be extremely important. The full truncation scheme outperforms all considered biased schemes in terms of bias and root-mean-squared error.},

@article{CruzCancino2010,
abstract = {An approach for the construction of A-stable high order explicit strong schemes for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with additive noise is proposed. We prove that such schemes also have the dynamical property that we call Random A-stability (RA-stability), which ensures that, for linear equations with stationary so- lutions, the numerical scheme has a random attractor that converges to the exact one as the step size decreases. Basically, the proposed integrators are obtained by split- ting, at each time step, the solution of the original equation into two parts: the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation plus the solution of an auxiliary SDE. The first one is solved by the Local Linearization scheme in such a way that A-stability is guaranteed, while the second one is approximated by any extant scheme, preferably an explicit one that yields high order of convergence with low computational cost. Numerical integrators constructed in this way are called High Order Local Linearization (HOLL) methods. Various efficient HOLL schemes are elaborated in detail, and their performance is illustrated through computer simulations. Furthermore, mean- square convergence of the introduced methods is studied.},

abstract = {In this article we compare the mean-square stability properties of the Theta-Maruyama and Theta-Milstein method that are used to solve stochastic differential equations. For the linear stability analysis, we propose an extension of the standard geometric Brownian motion as a test equation and consider a scalar linear test equation with several multiplicative noise terms. This test equation allows to begin investigating the influence of multi-dimensional noise on the stability behaviour of the methods while the analysis is still tractable. Our findings include: (i) the stability condition for the Theta-Milstein method and thus, for some choices of Theta, the conditions on the step-size, are much more restrictive than those for the Theta-Maruyama method; (ii) the precise stability region of the Theta-Milstein method explicitly depends on the noise terms. Further, we investigate the effect of introducing partially implicitness in the diffusion approximation terms of Milstein-type methods, thus obtaining the possibility to control the stability properties of these methods with a further method parameter Sigma. Numerical examples illustrate the results and provide a comparison of the stability behaviour of the different methods.},

Unfortunately, moments of the computationally efficient Euler-Maruyama approximation method diverge for these SDEs in finite time. This article develops a general theory based on rare events for studying integrability properties such as moment bounds for discrete-time stochastic processes. Using this approach, we establish moment bounds for fully and partially drift-implicit Euler methods and for a class of new explicit approximation methods which require only a few more arithmetical operations than the Euler-Maruyama method. These moment bounds are then used to prove strong convergence of the proposed schemes. Finally, we illustrate our results for several SDEs from finance, physics, biology and chemistry.},

Specifically, the general conditions under which this scheme preserves the stationary points and periodic orbits of the ODEs and the local stability at these steady states are studied. These dynamic properties are also examined by means of numerical experiments and the results are compared with those achieved by other numerical schemes. In addition, a brief review of the computational implementations of the LL scheme is also presented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

We further employ the model to study the system performance, considering the amount of biochemical noise in the trp level, the system rise time after a nutritional shift, and the amount of repressor molecules necessary to maintain an adequate level of repression, as indicators of the system performance regime. We demonstrate that the level of cooperativity between repressor molecules bound to the first two operators in the trp promoter affects all of the above enlisted performance characteristics. Moreover, the cooperativity level found in the wild-type bacterial strain optimizes a cost-benefit function involving low biochemical noise in the tryptophan level, short rise time after a nutritional shift, and low number of regulatory molecules.},

@article{Platen2008,
abstract = {When simulating discrete time approximations of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), numerical stability is clearly more important than numerical efficiency or some higher order of convergence. Discrete time approximations of solutions of SDEs are widely used in simulations in finance and other areas of application. The stability criterion presented is designed to handle both scenario simulation and Monte Carlo simulation, that is, strong and weak simulation methods. The symmetric predictor-corrector Euler method is shown to have the potential to overcome some of the numerical instabilities that may be experienced when using the explicit Euler method. This is of particular importance in finance, where martingale dynamics arise for solutions of SDEs and diffusion coefficients are often of multiplicative type. Stability regions for a range of schemes are visualized and discussed. For Monte Carlo simulation it turns out that schemes, which have implicitness in both the drift and the diffusion terms, exhibit the largest stability regions. It will be shown that refining the time step size in a Monte Carlo simulation can lead to numerical instabilities.},

Model., 136, 103 – 112, 2001). In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the same model by considering different parameters involved with the model as bifurcation param- eters in details. Considering the intrinsic growth rate of susceptible Tilapia fish as bifurcation parameter, we demonstrate the period doubling route to chaos. Next we consider the force of infection as bifurcation parameter and demonstrate the occurrence of two successive Hopf- bifurcations. We identify the existence of backward Hopf-bifurcation when the death rate of predators is considered as bifurcation parameter. Finally we construct a stochastic differential equation model corresponding to the deterministic model to understand the role of demographic stochasticity. Exhaustive numerical simulation of the stochastic model reveals the large ampli- tude fluctuation in the population of fish and Pelicans for certain parameter values. Extinction scenario for Pelicans is also captured from the stochastic model.},

abstract = {We seek numerical methods for second-order stochastic differential equations that reproduce the stationary density accurately for all values of damping. A complete analysis is possible for scalar linear second-order equations (damped harmonic oscillators with additive noise), where the statistics are Gaussian and can be calculated exactly in the continuous-time and discrete-time cases. A matrix equation is given for the stationary variances and correlation for methods using one Gaussian random variable per timestep. The only Runge–Kutta method with a nonsingular tableau matrix that gives the exact steady state density for all values of damping is the implicit midpoint rule. Numerical experiments, comparing the implicit midpoint rule with Heun and leapfrog methods on nonlinear equations with additive or multiplicative noise, produce behavior similar to the linear case},

@article{Vo2015,
abstract = {Wound healing and tumour growth involve collective cell spreading, which is driven by individual motility and proliferation events within a population of cells. Mathematical models are often used to interpret experimental data and to estimate the parameters so that predictions can be made. Existing methods for parameter estimation typically assume that these parameters are constants and often ignore any uncertainty in the estimated values. We use approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the cell diffusivity, D, and the cell proliferation rate, $\lambda$, from a discrete model of collective cell spreading, and we quantify the uncertainty associated with these estimates using Bayesian inference. We use a detailed experimental data set describing the collective cell spreading of 3T3 fibroblast cells. The ABC analysis is conducted for different combinations of initial cell densities and experimental times in two separate scenarios: (i) where collective cell spreading is driven by cell motility alone, and (ii) where collective cell spreading is driven by combined cell motility and cell proliferation. We find that D can be estimated precisely, with a small coefficient of variation (CV) of 2-6{\%}. Our results indicate that D appears to depend on the experimental time, which is a feature that has been previously overlooked. Assuming that the values of D are the same in both experimental scenarios, we use the information about D from the first experimental scenario to obtain reasonably precise estimates of $\lambda$, with a CV between 4 and 12{\%}. Our estimates of D and $\lambda$ are consistent with previously reported values; however, our method is based on a straightforward measurement of the position of the leading edge whereas previous approaches have involved expensive cell counting techniques. Additional insights gained using a fully Bayesian approach justify the computational cost, especially since it allows us to accommodate information from different experiments in a principled way.},

In contrast to Platen's method, which to the knowledge of the author has been up to now the only known third order Runge-Kutta scheme for weak approximation, the new class of methods affords less random variable evaluations and is also applicable to SDEs with multidimensional noise. Order conditions up to order three are calculated and coefficients of a four stage third order method are given. This method has deterministic order four and minimized error constants, and needs in addition less function evaluations than the method of Platen. Applied to some examples, the new method is compared numerically with Platen's method and some well known second order methods and yields very promising results.},

abstract = {We consider two-point boundary value problems for systems of first- order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Under natural conditions we show that on an arbitrary grid there exists a unique two-point exact difference scheme (EDS), i.e., a difference scheme whose solution coincides with the projection onto the grid of the exact solution of the corresponding system of differential equations. A constructive algorithm is proposed in order to derive from the EDS a so-called truncated difference scheme of an arbitrary rank m (m-TDS) possessing the order of accuracy O(|h|m) with respect to the maximal step size |h|. The m-TDS represents a system of nonlinear algebraic equations with respect to the approximate values of the exact solution on the grid. Iterative methods for its numerical solution are discussed. Analytical and numerical examples are given which illustrate the theorems proved},

Using Monte Carlo simulations, we compare a full likelihood procedure, where an option price is inverted into the unobservable volatility state, to an approximate likelihood procedure where the volatility state is replaced by proxies based on the implied volatility of a short-dated at-the-money option. The approximation results in a small loss of accuracy relative to the standard errors due to sampling noise. We apply this method to market prices of index options for several stochastic volatility models, and compare the characteristics of the estimated models. The evidence for a general CEV model, which nests both the affine Heston model and a GARCH model, suggests that the elasticity of variance of volatility lies between that assumed by the two nested models. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{LukaszSzpruch2010,
abstract = {The explicit solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be found only in a few cases. Therefore, there is a need for accurate numerical approximations that could, for example, enable Monte Carlo Simulations. Convergence and sta- bility of these methods are well understood for SDEs with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Our research focuses on those situations where the coefficients of the underlying SDEs are non-Lipschitzian. It was demonstrated in the literature, (Hutzenthaler and Jentzen 2009; Higham, Mao, and Yuan 2008) that in this case using the classical methods we may fail to obtain numerically computed paths that are accurate for small step-sizes, or to obtain qualitative information about the behaviour of numerical methods over long time intervals. This work addresses both of these issues, giving a customized analysis of the most widely used numer- ical methods. Motivated by existing work (Higham, Mao, and Stuart 2003b) and (Hu 1996) we consider implicit schemes. These authors have demonstrated that a backward Euler-Maruyama method strongly converges to the solution of SDEs with one-sided Lipschitz drift and linear growth diffusion coefficients. We extend their work by allowing for a polynomially growing diffusion term. The strong convergence is valuable as it reveals a pathwise error; new efficient Multi-Level Monte Carlo simulations (Giles 2008; Pages 2007) rely on strong convergence and weak convergence. In addition we examine global almost sure asymptotic stabil- ity in this nonlinear setting. In particular, we present a stochastic counterpart of the discrete LaSalle principle from which we deduce stability properties of im- plicit numerical methods. We also show that an appropriate implicit numerical method preserves positivity. In addition to being a desirable modelling property, in some cases positivity of the numerical approximation is required in order for the scheme to be well defined. Motivation for our work comes from finance and biology where many widely applied models do not satisfy a Lipschitz condition. We support our theoreti- cal results with relevant examples, such as stochastic interest rate models and stochastic volatility models. Although the considered schemes are implicit we point out that in many practical situations they do not increase computational complexity. We provide numerical results in support of our analysis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy associated with the development of a destructive osteolytic bone disease. RESULTS: Mathematical models are developed for normal bone remodeling and for the dysregulated bone remodeling that occurs in myeloma bone disease. The models examine the critical signaling between osteoclasts (bone resorption) and osteoblasts (bone formation). The interactions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are modeled as a system of differential equations for these cell populations, which exhibit stable oscillations in the normal case and unstable oscillations in the myeloma case. In the case of untreated myeloma, osteoclasts increase and osteoblasts decrease, with net bone loss as the tumor grows. The therapeutic effects of targeting both myeloma cells and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment on these dynamics are examined. CONCLUSIONS: The current model accurately reflects myeloma bone disease and illustrates how treatment approaches may be investigated using such computational approaches.

abstract = {A simple stochastic mathematical model is developed and investigated for early human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) population dynamics. The model, which is a multi-dimensional diffusion process, includes activated uninfected CD4(+)T cells, latently and actively infected CD4(+)T cells and free virions occurring in plasma. Stochastic effects are assumed to arise in the process of infection of CD4(+)T cells and transitions may occur from uninfected to latently or actively infected cells by chance mechanisms. Using the best currently available parameter values, the intrinsic variability in response to a given initial infection is examined by solving the stochastic system numerically. We estimate the statistical distributions of the time of occurrence and the magnitude of the early peak in viral concentration. The maximum of the viral load has a value in the experimental range and its time of occurrence has a 95{\%} confidence interval from 19.4 to 25.1 days. The stochastic nature of the growth of viral density is extremely pronounced in the first few days after initial infection. Threshold effects are noted at virion levels of about 3-5x10(-5) mm-3. In addition to modeling the intrinsic variability in HIV-1 growth, we have explored the effects of perturbations in the parameter values in order to assess the additional stochastic effects of between-patient variability. We found that changes in the initial number of virions or dose size, the rate at which latently infected CD4(+)T cells are converted to the actively infected form and the fraction of latent cells has only minor effects on the size, speed and variability of the response. In contrast, decreased speed and magnitude but greater variability in response were obtained when the death rate of uninfected CD4(+) T cells, the death rate of actively infected cells and the clearance rate of the virus were increased or when the appearance rate of uninfected CD4(+)T cells, the number of virions produced by infected cells, the infection rate of CD4(+)T cells and the initial number of uninfected activated CD4(+)T cells were decreased. We also determined the distribution of the time to reach a given virion density. From this distribution the probability of detection of the virus as a function of time can be estimated. The numerical results obtained are in the range of experimental values and are discussed in relation to recently proposed detection and testing procedures.},

abstract = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of "endogenous" stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

abstract = {Giles (Multilevel Monte Carlo path simulation Operations Research, 2008; 56:607-617) introduced a multi-level Monte Carlo method for approximating the expected value of a function of a stochastic differential equation solution. A key application is to compute the expected payff of a financial option. This new method improves on the computational complexity of standard Monte Carlo. Giles analysed globally Lipschitz payoffs, but also found good performance in practice for non-globally Lipschitz cases. In this work, we show that the multi-level Monte Carlo method can be rigorously justifed for non-globally Lipschitz payoffs. In particular, we consider digital, lookback and barrier options. This requires non-standard strong convergence analysis of the Euler-Maruyama method.},

abstract = {The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), originally introduced to sample exactly the invariant measure of certain stochastic differential equations (SDE) on infinitely long time intervals, can also be used to approximate pathwise the solution of these SDEs on finite time intervals. However, when applied to an SDE with a nonglobally Lipschitz drift coefficient, the algorithm may not have a spectral gap even when the SDE does. This paper reconciles MALA's lack of a spectral gap with its ergodicity to the invariant measure of the SDE and finite time accuracy. In particular, the paper shows that its convergence to equilibrium happens at exponential rate up to terms exponentially small in time-stepsize. This quantification relies on MALA's ability to exactly preserve the SDE's invariant measure and accurately represent the SDE's transition probability on finite time intervals.},

In an extension of earlier work, we lift the restriction that f obeys a global linear bound, and show that when f is locally Lipschitz, a function g can always be found so that the noise perturbation g(X(t)) dB(t) either stabilizes an unstable equilibrium, or destabilizes a stable equilibrium. When the equilibrium of the deterministic equation is nonhyperbolic, we show that a nonhyperbolic perturbation suffices to change the stability properties of the solution.},

For equations with additive noise we establish a sharp lower error bound in the class of arbitrary methods that use a fixed number of observations of the driving Brownian motion. As a consequence, higher order methods do not exist if the global error is analyzed. We introduce an adaptive step-size control for the Euler scheme which performs asymptotically optimally. In particular, the new method is more efficient than an equidistant discretization. This superiority is confirmed in simulation experiments for equations with additive noise, as well as for general scalar equations.},

abstract = {Kinetic theory is a mathematical framework intended to relate directly the most relevant characteristics of the molecular structure to the rheological behavior of the bulk system. In other words, kinetic theory is a micro-to-macro approach for solving the flow of complex fluids that circumvents the use of closure relations and offers a better physical description of the phenomena involved in the flow processes. Cornerstone models in kinetic theory employ beads, rods and springs for mimicking the molecular structure of the complex fluid. The generalized bead-rod-spring chain includes the most basic models in kinetic theory: the freely jointed bead-spring chain and the freely-jointed bead-rod chain. Configuration of simple coarse-grained models can be represented by an equivalent Fokker-Planck (FP) diffusion equation, which describes the evolution of the configuration distribution function in the physical and configurational spaces. FP equation can be a complex mathematical object, given its multidimensionality, and solving it explicitly can become a difficult task. Even more, in some cases, obtaining an equivalent FP equation is not possible given the complexity of the coarse-grained molecular model. Brownian dynamics can be employed as an alternative extensive numerical method for approaching the configuration distribution function of a given kinetic-theory model that avoid obtaining and/or resolving explicitly an equivalent FP equation. The validity of this discrete approach is based on the mathematical equivalence between a continuous diffusion equation and a stochastic differential equation as demonstrated by It{\^{o}} in the 1940s. This paper presents a review of the fundamental issues in the BD simulation of the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring coarse grained models in dilute solution. In the first part of this work, the BD numerical technique is introduced. An overview of the mathematical framework of the BD and a review of the scope of applications are presented. Subsequently, the links between the rheology of complex fluids, the kinetic theory and the BD technique are established at the light of the stochastic nature of the bead-rod-spring models. Finally, the pertinence of the present state-of-the-art review is explained in terms of the increasing interest for the stochastic micro-to-macro approaches for solving complex fluids problems. In the second part of this paper, a detailed description of the BD algorithm used for simulating a small-amplitude oscillatory deformation test is given. Dynamic properties are employed throughout this work to characterise the linear viscoelastic behavior of bead-rod-spring models in dilute solution. In the third and fourth part of this article, an extensive discussion about the main issues of a BD simulation in linear viscoelasticity of diluted suspensions is tackled at the light of the classical multi-bead-spring chain model and the multi-bead-rod chain model, respectively. Kinematic formulations, integration schemes and expressions to calculate the stress tensor are revised for several classical models: Rouse and Zimm theories in the case of multi-bead-spring chains, and Kramers chain and semi-flexible filaments in the case of multi-bead-rod chains. The implemented BD technique is, on the one hand, validated in front of the analytical or exact numerical solutions known of the equivalent FP equations for those classic kinetic theory models; and, on the other hand, is control-set thanks to the analysis of the main numerical issues involved in a BD simulation. Finally, the review paper is closed by some concluding remarks.},

On the basis of such an approach, for one-dimensional and multidimensional semi- linear transport equations of quite a general form with given initial data and boundary conditions the exact difference schemes (EDSs) are constructed. In the case of constant coefficients, such numerical methods can be created on rectangular grids, while in the case of variable coefficients – on moving grids only. The questions of developing differ- ence schemes of arbitrary order for quasi-linear transport equations with a nonlinear right-hand side are discussed. In this paper, the EDSs are constructed also for certain classes of linear and quasi- linear parabolic equations, for convection-diffusion problems with a small parameter, as well as inhomogeneous wave equations with constant coefficient},

abstract = {Existence of solutions for a class of doubly nonlinear evolution equations of second order is proven by studying a full discretization. The discretization combines a time stepping on a non- uniform time grid, which generalizes the well-known St¨ ormer–Verlet scheme, with an internal approximation scheme. The linear operator acting on the zero-order term is supposed to induce an inner product, whereas the nonlinear time-dependent operator acting on the first-order time derivative is as- sumed to be hemicontinuous, monotone and coercive (up to some additive shift), and to fulfill a certain growth condition. The analysis also extends to the case of additional nonlinear per- turbations of both the operators, provided the perturbations satisfy a certain growth and a lo- cal H¨ older-type continuity condition. A priori estimates are then derived in abstract fractional Sobolev spaces. Convergence in a weak sense is shown for piecewise polynomial prolongations in time of the fully discrete solutions under suitable requirements on the sequence of time grids.},

abstract = {To evaluate averages with respect to the invariant law for Langevin-type equations, one has to integrate a system over long time intervals, especially when dissipation is small. This is a challenging problem from the computational point of view. Since coefficients of the Langevin equations are typically not globally Lipschitz, the difficulties are redoubled. In the nonglobal Lipschitz case we observe an exploding behavior of some approximate trajectories due to many usual numerical methods. In [G.N. Milstein, M.V. Tretyakov, Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations with nonglobally Lipschitz coefficients, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 43 (2005) 1139-1154] we propose and justify a concept which, in principle, allows us to apply any numerical method to stochastic differential equations with nonglobally Lipschitz coefficients. Here quasi-symplectic integrators from [G.N. Milstein, M.V. Tretyakov, Quasi-symplectic methods for Langevin-type equations, IMA J. Numer. Anal. 23 (2003) 593-626] (they are the most appropriate methods for solving Langevin-type equations, especially when damping is small) and the concept of [G.N. Milstein, M.V. Tretyakov, Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations with nonglobally Lipschitz coefficients, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 43 (2005) 1139-1154] are applied for calculation of ergodic limits. Special attention is paid to the case when the invariant measure is known (e.g.,??when this measure is Gibbsian). Some computer experiments with three model problems (Van der Pol's equation with additive noise, one-dimensional arrays of oscillators in thermal equilibrium, and a physical pendulum with linear friction and additive noise) are presented. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Carbonell2007,
abstract = {The Local Linearization (LL) approach has become an effective technique for the numerical integration of ordinary, random, and stochastic differential equations. One of the reasons for this success is that the LL method achieves a convenient trade-off between numerical stability and computational cost. Besides, the LL method reproduces well the dynamics of nonlinear equations for which other classicalmethods fail. However, in the stochastic case, most of the reported works has been focused in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) driven by additive noise. This limits the applicability of the LL method since there is a number of interesting dynamics observed in equations with multiplicative noise. On the other hand, recent results show that commutative noise SDEs can be transformed into a random differential equation (RDE) by means of a random diffeomorfism (conjugacy). This paper takes advantages of such conjugacy property and the LL approach for defining a LL scheme for SDEs driven by commutative noise. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by means of numerical simulations},

abstract = {tions at a single point. We provide the exact rate of convergence of the mini- mal errors that can be achieved by arbitrary (in a measurable way) on a finite number of sequential observations of the driving Brownian motion. The resulting lower error bounds hold in particu- lar for all methods that are implementable on a computer and use a random number generator to simulate the driving Brownian motion at finitely many points. Our analysis shows that approximation at a single point is strongly connected to an integration problem for the driving Brownian motion with a random weight. Exploiting general ideas from estimation of weighted inte- grals of stochastic processes, we introduce an adaptive scheme, which is easy to implement and performs asymptotically optimally. We study pathwise approximation of scalar stochastic differential equa- numerical methods that are based},

We give a brief survey of the area focusing on a number of application areas where approximations to strong solutions are important, with a particular focus on computational biology applications, and give the necessary analytical tools for understanding some of the important concepts associated with stochastic processes. We present the stochastic Taylor series expansion as the fundamental mechanism for constructing effective numerical methods, give general results that relate local and global order of convergence and mention the Magnus expansion as a mechanism for designing methods that preserve the underlying structure of the problem. We also present various classes of explicit and implicit methods for strong solutions, based on the underlying structure of the problem. Finally, we discuss implementation issues relating to maintaining the Brownian path, efficient simulation of stochastic integrals and variable-step-size implementations based on various types of control.},

When the deterministic system admits a uniformly asymptotically stable slow manifold, we show that the sample paths of the stochastic system are concentrated in a neighbourhood of the slow manifold, which we construct explicitly. Depending on the dynamics of the reduced system, the results cover time spans which can be exponentially long in the noise intensity squared (that is, up to Kramers' time). We obtain exponentially small upper and lower bounds on the probability of exceptional paths. If the slow manifold contains bifurcation points, we show similar concentration properties for the fast variables corresponding to non-bifurcating modes. We also give conditions under which the system can be approximated by a lower-dimensional one, in which the fast variables contain only bifurcating modes.},

@article{Hydrology1989,
abstract = {The development of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations has intensified over the past decade. The earliest methods were usually heuristic adaptations of deterministic methods, but were found to have limited accuracy regardless of the order of the original scheme. A stochastic counterpart of the Taylor formula now provides a framework for the systematic investigation of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations. It suggests numerical schemes, which involve multiple stochastic integrals, of higher order of convergence. We shall survey the literature on these and on the earlier schemes in this paper. Our discussion will focus on diffusion processes, but we shall also indicate the extensions needed to handle processes with jump components. In particular, we shall classify the schemes according to strong or weak convergence criteria, depending on whether the approximation of the sample paths or of the probability distribution is of main interest.},

@article{Brugnano2000,
abstract = {The modelling of many real life phenomena for which either the parameter estima- tion is difficult, or which are subject to randomnoisy perturbations, is often carried out by using stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs). For this reason, in recent years much attention has been devoted to deriving numerical methods for approximat- ing their solution. In particular, in this paper we consider the use of linear multistep formulae (LMF). Strong order convergence conditions up to order 1 are stated, for both commutative and non-commutative problems. The case of additive noise is fur- ther investigated, in order to obtain order improvements. The implementation of the methods is also considered, leading to a predictor-corrector approach. Some numerical tests on problems taken from the literature are also included.},

Then we study the relationship between irreducibility of a quantum Markov semigroup and properties of these diffusions such as accessibility, the Lie algebra rank condition, and irreducibility. We prove that all these properties are, in general, weaker than irreducibility of the quantum Markov semigroup, nevertheless, they are equivalent for some important classes of semigroups.},

abstract = {Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is commonly used in many branches of science. In this paper we present how to accelerate this kind of numerical calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units using the CUDA programming environment. We address general aspects of numerical programming on stream processors and illustrate them by two examples: the noisy phase dynamics in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as 675?? compared to a typical CPU, which corresponds to several billion integration steps per second. This means that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in less than one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a completely new level, opening for research a whole new range of problems which can now be solved interactively. Program summary: Program title: SDE. Catalogue identifier: AEFG{\_}v1{\_}0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEFG{\_}v1{\_}0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Gnu GPL v3. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 978. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 5905. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: CUDA C. Computer: any system with a CUDA-compatible GPU. Operating system: Linux. RAM: 64 MB of GPU memory. Classification: 4.3. External routines: The program requires the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Version 2.0 or newer and the GNU Scientific Library v1.0 or newer. Optionally gnuplot is recommended for quick visualization of the results. Nature of problem: Direct numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is a computationally intensive problem, due to the necessity of calculating multiple independent realizations of the system. We exploit the inherent parallelism of this problem and perform the calculations on GPUs using the CUDA programming environment. The GPU's ability to execute hundreds of threads simultaneously makes it possible to speed up the computation by over two orders of magnitude, compared to a typical modern CPU. Solution method: The stochastic Runge-Kutta method of the second order is applied to integrate the equation of motion. Ensemble-averaged quantities of interest are obtained through averaging over multiple independent realizations of the system. Unusual features: The numerical solution of the stochastic differential equations in question is performed on a GPU using the CUDA environment. Running time: < 1 minute. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the evolution of a system composed of two predator-prey deterministic systems described by Lotka-Volterra equations in random environment. It is proved that under the influence of telegraph noise, all positive trajectories of such a system always go out from any compact set of int R+
2 with probability one if two rest points of the two systems do not coincide. In case where they have the rest point in common, the trajectory either leaves from any compact set of int R+
2 or converges to the rest point. The escape of the trajectories from any compact set means that the system is neither permanent nor dissipative. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stochastic differential equations (SDE's) play an important role in physics but existing numerical methods for solving such equations are of low accuracy and poor stability. A general strategy for developing accurate and efficient schemes for solving stochastic equations is outlined here. High-order numerical methods are developed for the integration of stochastic differential equations with strong solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting integration schemes by computing the errors in approximate solutions for SDE's which have known exact solutions.},

@article{Callaway2002,
abstract = {Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) reduces the viral burden in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected patients below the threshold of detectability. However, substantial evidence indicates that viral replication persists in these individuals. In this paper we examine the ability of several biologically motivated models of HIV-1 dynamics to explain sustained low viral loads. At or near drug efficacies that result in steady state viral loads below detectability, most models are extremely sensitive to small changes in drug efficacy. We argue that if these models reflect reality many patients should have cleared the virus, contrary to observation. We find that a model in which the infected cell death rate is dependent on the infected cell density does not suffer this shortcoming. The shortcoming is also overcome in two more conventional models that include small populations of cells in which the drug is less effective than in the main population, suggesting that difficulties with drug penetrance and maintenance of effective intracellular drug concentrations in all cells susceptible to HIV infection may underlie ongoing viral replication.},

@article{Chirico1996,
abstract = {The recently presented Brownian dynamics model for superhelical DNA is extended to include local curvature of the DNA helix axis. Here we analyze the effect of a permanent bend on the structure and dynamics of an 1870-bp superhelix with delta Lk = -10. Furthermore, we define quantitative expressions for computing structural parameters such as loop positions, superhelix diameter, and plectonemic content for trajectories of superhelical DNA, and assess the convergence toward global equilibrium. The structural fluctuations in an interwound superhelix, as reflected in the change in end loop positions, seem to occur by destruction/creation of loops rather than by a sliding motion of the DNA around its contour. Their time scale is on the order of 30-100 microseconds. A permanent bend changes the structure and the internal motions of the DNA drastically. The position of the end loop is fixed at the permanent bend, and the local motions of the chain are enhanced near the loops. A displacement of the bend from the end loop to a position inside the plectonemic part of the superhelix results in the formation of a new loop and the disappearance of the old one; we estimate the time involved in this process to be about 0.5 ms.},

abstract = {The present paper introduces a new diffusion process for the purpose of modelling logistic-type behaviour patterns. Unlike other processes in the same context, this one verifies that its mean function is a logistic curve. In addition, its transition density can be found explicitly, which allows to analyse inference from the discrete sampling of trajectories. The main features of the process will be analysed and the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters will be carried out through discrete sampling. Regarding the numerical problems found to solve the likelihood equations, several strategies are developed for obtaining initial solutions for the usual numerical procedures. Such strategies are compared by means of a simulation example. Also, another simulation study is carried out in order to compare the estimation in this process to that developed by means of continuous sampling in the logistic diffusion model considered by Giovanis and Skiadas (1999). Finally an example is given for the growth of a microorganism culture. This example illustrates the predictive possibilities of the new process, as well as its ability to study time variables formulated as first-passage-times.},

In addition we examine the globally almost surely asymptotic stability in this non-linear setting for EM type schemes. In particular, we present a stochastic counterpart of the discrete LaSalle principle from which we deduce stability properties for numerical methods.},

abstract = {The local linearization (LL) method for the integration of ordinary differential equations is an explicit one-step method that has a number of suitable dynamical properties. However, a major drawback of the LL integrator is that its order of convergence is only two. The present paper overcomes this limitation by introducing a new class of numerical integrators, called the LLT method, that is based on the addition of a correction term to the LL approximation. In this way an arbitrary order of convergence can be achieved while retaining the dynamic properties of the LL method. In particular, it is proved that the LLT method reproduces correctly the phase portrait of a dynamical system near hyperbolic stationary points to the order of convergence. The performance of the introduced method is further illustrated through computer simulations. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recent results extend this convergence to coefficients which grow at most linearly. For superlinearly growing coefficients finite-time convergence in the strong mean square sense remained an open question according to [Higham, Mao {\&} Stuart (2002); Strong convergence of Euler-type methods for nonlinear stochastic differential equations, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 40, no. 3, 1041-1063]. In this article we answer this question to the negative and prove for a large class of stochastic differential equations with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients that Euler's approximation converges neither in the strong mean square sense nor in the numerically weak sense to the exact solution at a finite time point. Even worse, the difference of the exact solution and of the numerical approximation at a finite time point diverges to infinity in the strong mean square sense and in the numerically weak sense.},

abstract = {Biofilm forming microbes have complex effects on the flow properties of natural porous media. Subsurface biofilms have the potential for the formation of biobarriers to inhibit contaminant migration in groundwater. Another example of beneficial microbial effects is the biotransformation of organic contaminants to less harmful forms, thereby providing an in situ method for treatment of contaminated groundwater supplies. Mathematical models that describe contaminant transport with biodegradation involve a set of coupled convection-dispersion equations with non-linear reactions. The reactive solute transport equation is one for which numerical solution procedures continue to exhibit significant limitations for certain problems of groundwater hydrology interest. Accurate numerical simulations are crucial to the development of contaminant remediation strategies. A new numerical method is developed for simulation of reactive bacterial transport in porous media. The non-standard numerical approach is based on the ideas of the 'exact' time-stepping scheme. It leads to solutions free from the numerical instabilities that arise from incorrect modeling of derivatives and reaction terms. Applications to different biofilm models are examined and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed new method.},

abstract = {Weak local linear (WLL) discretizations are playing an increasing role in the construction of effective numerical integrators and inference methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with additive noise. However, due to limitations in the existing numerical implementations of WLL discretizations, the resulting integrators and inference methods have either been restricted to particular classes of autonomous SDEs or showed low computational efficiency. Another limitation is the absence of a systematic theoretical study of the rate of convergence of the WLL discretizations and numerical integratos. This task is the main purpose of the present paper. A second goal is introducing a new WLL scheme that overcomes the numerical limitations mentioned above. Additionally, a comparative analysis between the new WLL scheme and some conventional weak integrators is also presented. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Populations of competing biological species exhibit a fascinating interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of evolutionary selection forces and random fluctuations arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors. In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and can be generalized numerically to more complex situations. The extinction probability distributions and other quantities of interest we obtain show excellent agreement with simulations.},

@article{Kowarschik2003,
abstract = {In order to mitigate the impact of the growing gap between CPU speed and main memory performance, today’s computer architectures implement hierarchical memory structures. The idea behind this approach is to hide both the low main memory bandwidth and the latency of main memory accesses which is slow in contrast to the floating-point performance of the CPUs. Usually, there is a small and expensive high speed memory sitting on top of the hierarchy which is usually integrated within the processor chip to provide data with low latency and high bandwidth; i.e., the CPU registers. Moving further away from the CPU, the layers of memory successively become larger and slower. The memory components which are located between the processor core and main memory are called cache memories or caches. They are intended to contain copies of main memory blocks to speed up accesses to frequently needed data [378], [392]. The next lower level of the memory hierarchy is the main memory which is large but also comparatively slow. While external memory such as hard disk drives or remote memory components in a distributed computing environment represent the lower end of any common hierarchical memory design, this paper focuses on optimization techniques for enhancing cache performance.},

@article{Kahl2008,
abstract = {In many applications, differential equation models require geometric integration, i.e., the application of structure-preserving integration schemes. In computational finance, for example, the numerical simulation of extended Libor market models used to value structured interest rate derivatives has to preserve positivity or boundedness of the underlying stochastic processes used to model mean-reverting volatility or forward rates. This paper discusses how stochastic integration schemes can be constructed in order to maintain these properties of the analytical solution. Milstein-type methods prove to be the method-of-choice with respect to both efficiency and preservation of structural properties, as they turn out to dominate the increments of Brownian motions. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical tests. © 2006 IMACS.},

abstract = {One of the most promising methods for simulating moments or other expectations of functionals of the solution process of a stochastic differential equation is the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method in [Giles, M. B., Multilevel Monte Carlo Path Simulation, Operations Research 56 (2008), no. 3, 606-617]. This method has been shown to converge if the coefficients of the SDE are globally Lipschitz continuous. In this article we establish that the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method does, in general, not converge if the coefficients of the SDE are not globally Lipschitz continuous. More precisely, the main result of this article proves divergence of the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method for a family of SDEs with superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficients. This divergence result reveals that the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method often produces completely wrong values in the case of SDEs with superlinearly growing coefficients. Additionally, this divergence of the new multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method is in fundamental contrast to the convergence of the classical Monte Carlo Euler method for such SDEs. Nonetheless, the multilevel Monte Carlo method combined with a strongly convergent numerical approximation method does converge. In particular, we show that the multilevel Monte Carlo Euler method combined with a tamed Euler method converges for such SDEs.},

abstract = {The stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of motion for a classical magnetic moment is numerically solved properly observing the customary interpretation of it as a Stratonovich stochastic differential equation, in order to study the dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles. The corresponding Langevin-dynamics approach allows for the study of the fluctuating trajectories of individual magnetic moments, where we have encountered remarkable phenomena in the overbarrier rotation process, such as crossing-back or multiple crossing of the potential barrier, rooted in the gyromagnetic nature of the system. Concerning averaged quantities, we study the linear dynamic response of the archetypal ensemble of noninteracting classical magnetic moments with axially symmetric magnetic anisotropy. The results are compared with different analytical expressions used to model the relaxation of nanoparticle ensembles, assessing their accuracy. It has been found that, among a number of heuristic expressions for the linear dynamic susceptibility, only the simple formula proposed by Shliomis and Stepanov matches the coarse features of the susceptibility reasonably.

abstract = {he initial boundary-value problem for the two-dimensional heat con- duction equation ∂u ∂t = ∂ 1 +h2 ∂x1 k1(u) ∂u ∂x1 + ∂ ∂x2 k2(u) ∂u ∂x2  is considered. A new difference scheme approximating the above equation is con- structed. The error of approximation of the considered scheme is O(($\sigma$ − 0.5)(h1 + h2+$\tau$)+h2 2+$\tau$2), where $\sigma$ is a weight. The main difference between the method proposed in the present paper and the other difference schemes is that for the traveling wave solutions u(x, t) = U1 2ax1 + 1 2bx2 −t, 0  x1  l1, 0  x2  l2, 0  t  T, the considered scheme is exact if the grid steps satisfy definite conditions $\gamma$1 = a$\tau$/h1 = 1/2, $\gamma$2 = b$\tau$/h2 = 1/2. The iteration method is used to solve a nonlinear difference equation.},

This work proposes a semi-tamed Euler scheme, which is also explicit, to solve the SDEs with the drift coefficient equipped with the Lipschitz continuous part and non-Lipschitz continuous part. It is shown that the semi-tamed Euler converges strongly with the standard order one-half to the exact solution of the SDE. We also investigate the stability inheritance of the semi-tamed Euler schemes and reveal that this scheme does have advantage in reproducing the exponential mean square stability of the exact solution. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This note extends and interprets a result of Saito andMitsui [SIAM J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), pp. 2254–2267] for a method of Milstein. The result concerns mean-square stability on a stochastic differential equation test problem with multiplicative noise. The numerical method reduces to the Theta Method on deterministic problems. Saito and Mitsui showed that the deterministic A-stability property of the Theta Method does not carry through to the mean-square context in general, and gave a condition un- der which unconditional stability holds. The main purpose of this note is to emphasize that the approach of Saito and Mitsui makes it possible to quantify precisely the point where unconditional stability is lost in terms of the ratio of the drift (deterministic) and diffusion (stochastic) coefficients. This leads to a concept akin to deterministic A($\alpha$)-stability that may be useful in the stability analysis of more general methods. It is also shown that mean-square A-stability is recovered if the Theta Method parameter is increased beyond its normal range to the value 3/2.},

@article{Goychuk2004,
abstract = {A stochastic approach to the quantum dynamics randomly modulated in time by a discrete state non-Markovian noise, which possesses an arbitrary nonexponential distribution of the residence times, is developed. The formally exact expression for the Laplace-transformed quantum propagator averaged over the stationary realizations of such N -state non-Markovian noise is obtained. The theory possesses a wide range of applications. It includes some previous Markovian and non-Markovian theories as particular cases. In the context of the stochastic theory of spectral line shape and relaxation, the developed approach presents a non-Markovian generalization of the Kubo-Anderson theory of sudden modulation. In particular, the exact analytical expression is derived for the spectral line shape of optical transitions described by a Kubo oscillator with randomly modulated frequency which undergoes jumplike non-Markovian fluctuations in time.},

abstract = {The author advocates two specific mathematical notations from his popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete Mathematics". The first of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.},

abstract = {Our aim is to study under what conditions the exact and numerical solution (based on equidistant nonrandom partitions of integration time-intervals) to a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) share the property of mean-square exponential stability. Our approach is trying to avoid the use of Lyapunov functions or functionals.We show that under a global Lipschitz assumption an SDDE is exponentially stable in mean square if and only if for some sufficiently small stepsizethe Euler–Maruyama (EM) method is exponentially stable in mean square. We then replace the global Lipschitz condition with a finite-time convergence condition and establish the same “if and only if” result. The important feature of this result is that it transfers the asymptotic problem into a finite-time convergence problem. Replacing the exact andEMnumerical solution with stochastic processes, we also discuss whether a family of stochastic processes share the stability property. This new approach allows us to discuss (i) whether a family of SDDEs share the stability property, and (ii) whether an SDDE with variable time lag shares stability property with the modifiedEMmethod. As another application of this general approach we consider a linear SDDE with variable time lag and establish an “if and only if” result. It should also be mentioned that the questions addressed, results proved, as well as style of analysis borrow heavily from [14] but the computations involved to cope with time delay are nontrivial},

abstract = {We consider the nonlinear stochastic difference equation X n+1=Xn - f(Xn)+$\sigma$$\xi$n+1, n=0,1,..., X0 ∈ ℝ. Here, ($\xi$n)n∈ℕ is a sequence of independent random variables with zero mean and unit variance and with distribution functions Fn. The function f : ℝ→ℝ is continuous, f(0)=0, xf(x)>0 for x ≠ 0. We establish a condition on the noise intensity $\sigma$ and the rate of decay of the tails of the distribution functions Fn, under which the convergence of solutions to zero occurs with probability zero. If this condition does not hold, and f is bounded by a linear function with slope 2 - $\gamma$, for $\gamma$∈(0, 2), all solutions tend to zero a.s. On the other hand, if f grows more quickly than linear function with slope 2 + $\gamma$, for >0, the solutions tend to infinity in modulus with arbitrarily high probability, once the initial condition is chosen sufficiently large. Such equations can still demonstrate local stability; for a wide class of highly nonlinear f, it is shown that solutions tend to zero with arbitrarily high probability, once the initial condition is chosen appropriately. Results which elucidate the relationship between the rate of decay of the noise intensities and the rate of decay of the tails, and the necessary condition for stability, are presented. The connection with the asymptotic dynamical consistency of the system, when viewed as a discretisation of an Ito stochastic differential equation, is also explored. © 2008 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

We consider three types of particle interactions, namely, Weeks-Chandler-Andersen, screened Coulomb, and superparamagnetic potentials. We find that, regardless of the interaction potential, at low densities particles are distributed in a typical fluidlike structure and at higher densities or potential strengths become spatially correlated at long-distances. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that one-dimensional systems, with particles interacting repulsively, show common structural and dynamical behaviors at the boundary in which the degree of ordering changes dramatically; the main peak of the static structure factor becomes highly narrow with a height of S(c)≈7, whereas the reduced mobility factor F, which is associated with the single-file diffusion at long-times or long wavelengths, reaches values F(∗)≈0.1. These features are analyzed and discussed in the context of a local order-disorder transition.},

abstract = {We study the pathwise (strong) approximation of scalar stochastic differential equations with respect to the global error in the L2-norm. For equations with additive noise we establish a sharp lower error bound in the class of arbitrary methods that use a fixed number of observations of the driving Brownian motion. As a consequence, higher order methods do not exist if the global error is analyzed. We introduce an adaptive step-size control for the Euler scheme which performs asymptotically optimally. In particular, the new method is more efficient than an equidistant discretization. This superiority is confirmed in simulation experiments for equations with additive noise, as well as for general scalar equations.},

This unification, via the theory of random dynamical systems (RDS), allows one to consider the detailed geometric structure of the random attractors associated with nonlinear, stochastically perturbed systems. We report on high-resolution numerical studies of two idealized models of fundamental interest for climate dynamics. The first of the two is a stochastically forced version of the classical Lorenz model. The second one is a low-dimensional, nonlinear stochastic model of the El NioSouthern Oscillation (ENSO). These studies provide a good approximation of the two models' global random attractors, as well as of the time-dependent invariant measures supported by these attractors; the latter are shown to have an intuitive physical interpretation as random versions of SinaRuelleBowen (SRB) measures. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We consider the Euler discretisation of a scalar linear test equation with positive solutions and show for both strong and weak approximations that the probability of positivity over any finite interval of simulation tends to unity as the step size approaches zero. Although a.s. positivity in an approximation is impossible to achieve, we develop for the strong (Maruyama) approximation an asymptotic estimate of the number of mesh points required for positivity as our tolerance of non-positive trajectories tends to zero, and examine the effectiveness of this estimate in the context of practical numerical simulation. We show how this analysis generalises to equations with a drift coefficient that may display a high level of nonlinearity, but which must be linearly bounded from below (i.e. when acting towards zero), and a linearly bounded diffusion coefficient. Finally, in the linear case we develop a refined asymptotic estimate that is more useful as an a priori guide to the number of mesh points required to produce positive approximations with a given probability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

It also presents new results on strong discrete time approximations for the specific case of pure jump SDEs. Strong approximations based on jump-adapted time discretizations, which produce no discretization error in the case of pure jump processes, are analyzed. The computational complexity of these approximations is proportional to the jump intensity. By exploiting a stochastic expansion for pure jump processes, higher order discrete time approximations, whose computational complexity is not dependent on the jump intensity, are proposed. For the specific case of pure jump SDEs, the strong order of convergence of strong Taylor schemes is established under weaker conditions than those currently known in the literature. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Recent nonparametric estimation studies pioneered by Ait-Sahalia document that the diffusion of the short rate is similar to the parametric function, r1.5, estimated by Chan et al., whereas the drift is substantially nonlinear in the short rate. These empirical properties call into question the efficacy of the existing affine term structure models and beg for alternative models which admit the observed behavior. This article presents such a model. Our model delivers closed-form solutions for bond prices and a concave relationship between the interest rate and the yields. We show that in empirical analyses, our model outperforms the one-factor affine models in both time-series as well as cross-sectional tests.},

@article{Chen2004,
abstract = {This paper serves as an introductory review of Brownian Dynamics (BD), Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo (MC) modeling techniques. These three simulation methods have proven to be exceptional investigative solutions for probing discrete molecular, ionic, and colloidal motions at their basic microscopic levels. The review offers a general study of the classical theories and algorithms that are foundational to Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. Important topics of interest include fundamental theories that govern Brownian motion, the Langevin equation, the Verlet algorithm, and the Metropolis method. Brownian Dynamics demonstrates advantages over Molecular Dynamics as pertaining to the issue of time-scale separation. Monte Carlo methods exhibit strengths in terms of ease of implementation. Hybrid techniques that combine these methods and draw from these efficacies are also presented. With their rigorous microscopic approach, Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods prove to be especially viable modeling methods for problems with challenging complexities such as high-level particle concentration and multiple particle interactions. These methods hold promising potential for effective modeling of transport in colloidal systems.},

abstract = {In this lecture, we examine the dynamics of suspensions of mesoscopic (Brownian) particles in a molecular fluid, starting from first principles. We introduce the technique of multiple time-scales to derive the Fokker–Planck equation for a single, or for a set of interacting Brownian particles, start- ing from the Liouville equation for the full system (Brownian particles and discrete bath). The limitations of the Fokker–Planck equation will then be emphasized. In particular, we shall point out that under “standard” experimental conditions, the Fokker–Planck description cannot be correct and that non-Markovian effects are expected. A microscopic description in the true experimental limit confirms this breakdown and leads to a "gen- eralized" (non-Markovian and non-local in velocity space) Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the thermalization of the Brownian particle.},

abstract = {The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), originally introduced to sample exactly the invariant measure of certain stochastic differential equations (SDE) on infinitely long time intervals, can also be used to approximate pathwise the solution of these SDEs on finite time intervals. However, when applied to an SDE with a nonglobally Lipschitz drift coefficient, the algorithm may not have a spectral gap even when the SDE does. This paper reconciles MALA's lack of a spectral gap with its ergodicity to the invariant measure of the SDE and finite time accuracy. In particular, the paper shows that its convergence to equilibrium happens at exponential rate up to terms exponentially small in time-stepsize. This quantification relies on MALA's ability to exactly preserve the SDE's invariant measure and accurately represent the SDE's transition probability on finite time intervals.},

Nevertheless, in the case of additive stochastic Hamiltonian problems an extension of these ideas, which requires the simulation of an independent Wiener process at each stage of a Runge–Kutta method, leads to methods that have very favourable properties.

The existing known results have only so far shown that the classical (explicit) Euler-Maruyama (EM) approximate solutions converge to the true solution in probability [22,23]. More recently, the authors in [16] proved that the classical EM method will diverge in L2 sense for the underlying SDEs in this paper (and those SDEs with superlinearly growing coefficients). These strongly indicate that the classical EM method is not good enough for the highly nonlinear SDEs. However, in this paper, we introduce a modified EM method using stopping time and show successfully that the discrete version of the modified EM approximate solution converges to the true solution in the strong sense (namely in L2) with a order arbitrarily close to a half. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The mean extinction-time depends on the initial population size and satisfies the backward Kolmogorov differential equation, a linear second-order partial differential equation with variable coefficients; hence, finding analytical solutions poses severe problems, except in a few simple cases, so we can only compute numerical approximations (an idea already mentioned in Sharp and Allen (1998) [1]). In this paper, we study a stochastic Lotka-Volterra model (Allen, 2007) [2, p. 149]; we prove the nonnegative character of its solutions for the corresponding backward Kolmogorov differential equation; we propose a finite element method, whose Matlab code is offered in the Appendix; and, finally, we make a direct comparison between predictions and numerical simulations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We introduce TestU01, a software library implemented in the ANSI C language, and offering a collection of utilities for the empirical statistical testing of uniform random number generators (RNGs). It provides general implementations of the classical statistical tests for RNGs, as well as several others tests proposed in the literature, and some original ones. Predefined tests suites for sequences of uniform random numbers over the interval (0, 1) and for bit sequences are available. Tools are also offered to perform systematic studies of the interaction between a specific test and the structure of the point sets produced by a given family of RNGs. That is, for a given kind of test and a given class of RNGs, to determine how large should be the sample size of the test, as a function of the generator's period length, before the generator starts to fail the test systematically. Finally, the library provides various types of generators implemented in generic form, as well as many specific generators proposed in the literature or found in widely used software. The tests can be applied to instances of the generators predefined in the library, or to user-defined generators, or to streams of random numbers produced by any kind of device or stored in files. Besides introducing TestU01, the article provides a survey and a classification of statistical tests for RNGs. It also applies batteries of tests to a long list of widely used RNGs.},

abstract = {Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is commonly used in many branches of science. In this paper we present how to accelerate this kind of numerical calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units using the CUDA programming environment. We address general aspects of numerical programming on stream processors and illustrate them by two examples: the noisy phase dynamics in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as 675?? compared to a typical CPU, which corresponds to several billion integration steps per second. This means that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in less than one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a completely new level, opening for research a whole new range of problems which can now be solved interactively. Program summary: Program title: SDE. Catalogue identifier: AEFG{\_}v1{\_}0. Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEFG{\_}v1{\_}0.html. Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland. Licensing provisions: Gnu GPL v3. No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 978. No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 5905. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: CUDA C. Computer: any system with a CUDA-compatible GPU. Operating system: Linux. RAM: 64 MB of GPU memory. Classification: 4.3. External routines: The program requires the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Version 2.0 or newer and the GNU Scientific Library v1.0 or newer. Optionally gnuplot is recommended for quick visualization of the results. Nature of problem: Direct numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is a computationally intensive problem, due to the necessity of calculating multiple independent realizations of the system. We exploit the inherent parallelism of this problem and perform the calculations on GPUs using the CUDA programming environment. The GPU's ability to execute hundreds of threads simultaneously makes it possible to speed up the computation by over two orders of magnitude, compared to a typical modern CPU. Solution method: The stochastic Runge-Kutta method of the second order is applied to integrate the equation of motion. Ensemble-averaged quantities of interest are obtained through averaging over multiple independent realizations of the system. Unusual features: The numerical solution of the stochastic differential equations in question is performed on a GPU using the CUDA environment. Running time: < 1 minute. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Anti-viral drug treatment of infections with the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) usually leads to a rapid decline in the abundance of plasma virus. The effect of single drug therapy, however, is often only short-lived as the virus readily develops drug-resistant mutants. In this paper we provide analytic approximations for the rate of emergence of resistant virus. We study the decline of wildtype virus and the rise of resistant mutant virus in different compartments of the virus population such as free plasma virus, cells infected with actively replicating virus, long-lived infected cells and cells carrying defective provirus. The model results are compared with data on the rise of drug-resistant virus in three HIV-1 infected patients treated with neverapine (NVP). We find that the half-life of latently infected cells is between 10 and 20 days, whereas the half-life of cells with defective provirus is about 80 days. We also provide a crude estimate for the basic reproductive ratio of HIV-1 during NVP therapy.},

abstract = {For stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz continuous drift coefficient, the explicit schemes fail to converge strongly to the exact solution. Recently, an explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the tamed Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen, {\&} Kloeden (2010); Strong convergence of an explicit numerical method for SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients, arXiv:1010.3756v1] for such SDEs. Motivated by their work, we here introduce a tamed version of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative noise. The proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable. Moreover, it achieves higher strong order than the tamed Euler method. Note that new difficulties arise in recovering the strong convergence order one and new techniques are developed to overcome them. Finally, an illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency of this explicit numerical scheme compared to the tamed Euler method.},

abstract = {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations. The methods provide fully automated adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs that are required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where different scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the local structure when simulating paths across this manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of these Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed by performing inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described by non-linear differential equations. Substantial improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size are reported when compared with alternative sampling approaches. MATLAB code that is available from http://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/research/rmhmc allows replication of all the results reported.},

Monolayers of paramagnetic polystyrene spheres confined to an air/water interface are studied using digital videomicroscopy. The interparticle potential tuned by an external magnetic field is accurately calibrated by comparing measured radial distribution functions with computer simulation results. This allows one to separate the effects of HI on Dst from those of the direct interactions},

Here, we focus on these stability properties in the limit as the timestep tends to zero. Our analysis is motivated by an example of an exponentially almost surely stable nonlinear SDE for which the Euler–Maruyama (EM) method fails to reproduce this behavior for any nonzero timestep. We begin by showing that EM correctly reproduces almost sure and small-moment exponential stability for sufficiently small timesteps on scalar linear SDEs. We then generalize our results to multidimensional nonlinear SDEs. We show that when the SDE obeys a linear growth condition, EM recovers almost surely exponential stability very well. Under the less restrictive condition that the drift coefficient of the SDE obeys a one-sided Lipschitz condition, where EM may break down, we show that the backward Euler method maintains almost surely exponential stability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider Langevin processes with mechanical constraints. The latter are a fundamental tool in molecular dynamics simulation for sampling purposes and for the computation of free energy differences. The results of this paper can be divided into three parts. (i) We propose a simple discretization of the constrained Langevin process based on a standard splitting strategy. We show how to correct the scheme so that it samples {\{}$\backslash$em exactly{\}} the canonical measure restricted on a submanifold, using a Metropolis rule in the spirit of the Generalized Hybrid Monte Carlo (GHMC) algorithm. Moreover, we obtain, in some limiting regime, a consistent discretization of the overdamped Langevin (Brownian) dynamics on a submanifold, also sampling exactly the correct canonical measure with constraints. The corresponding numerical methods can be used to sample (without any bias) a probability measure supported by a submanifold. (ii) For free energy computation using thermodynamic integration, we rigorously prove that the longtime average of the Lagrange multipliers of the constrained Langevin dynamics yields the gradient of a rigid version of the free energy associated with the constraints. A second order time discretization using the Lagrange multipliers is proposed. (iii) The Jarzynski-Crooks fluctuation relation is proved for Langevin processes with mechanical constraints evolving in time. An original numerical discretization without time-step error is proposed. Numerical illustrations are provided for (ii) and (iii).},

More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived.},

@article{Thalmann2007,
abstract = {This paper focuses on the temporal discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and on different resulting numerical integration schemes. Using a method based on the exponentiation of time dependent operators, we carefully derive a numerical scheme for the Langevin dynamics, which we found equivalent to the proposal of Ermak and Buckholtz [J. Comput. Phys. 35, 169 (1980)] and not simply to the stochastic version of the velocity-Verlet algorithm. However, we checked on numerical simulations that both algorithms give similar results, and share the same "weak order two" accuracy. We then apply the same strategy to derive and test two numerical schemes for the dissipative particle dynamics. The first one of them was found to compare well, in terms of speed and accuracy, with the best currently available algorithms.},

@article{Lamba2007,
abstract = {The understanding of adaptive algorithms for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is an open area, where many issues related to both convergence and stability (long-time behaviour) of algorithms are unresolved. This paper considers a very simple adaptive algorithm, based on controlling only the drift component of a time step. Both convergence and stability are studied. The primary issue in the convergence analysis is that the adaptive method does not necessarily drive the time steps to zero with the user-input tolerance. This possibility must be quantified and shown to have low probability. The primary issue in the stability analysis is ergodicity. It is assumed that the noise is nondegenerate, so that the diffusion process is elliptic, and the drift is assumed to satisfy a coercivity condition. The SDE is then geometrically ergodic (averages converge to statistical equilibrium exponentially quickly). If the drift is not linearly bounded, then explicit fixed time step approximations, such as the Euler-Maruyama scheme, may fail to be ergodic. In this work, it is shown that the simple adaptive time-stepping strategy cures this problem. In addition to proving ergodicity, an exponential moment bound is also proved, generalizing a result known to hold for the SDE itself.},

abstract = {We consider two ways to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient of interacting Brownian particles. The first approach is based on the calculation of the mean square displacement of a Brownian particle starting from the Smoluchowski equation. In the second approach the self-diffusion coefficient is obtained as the product of the thermodynamic driving force and the mobility. The advantages and limitations of the two methods are discussed.},
