  Abstract                 = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of "endogenous" stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

Under appropriate conditions the numerical solutions converge in mean square sense to the true solution. There is a general belief, supported by theorems for the Euler--Maruyama and Milstein methods that the above statement implies the stochastic stability, i.e., the continuous dependence on initial values of the numerical solutions. In this paper this assertion is rigorously proved for methods widely used, but not investigated from this aspect.},

The algorithms are tested using a one-dimensional biharmonic Langevin oscillator process. Limitations in the conventional Brownian dynamics algorithm are shown and it is demonstrated that much better accuracy for dynamical quantities can be achieved with an algorithm based on the stochastic expansion, which is superior to the stochastic second-order Runge-Kutta algorithm. For static properties the relative accuracies of the SE and Runge-Kutta algorithms depend on the property calculated.},

We then carry out a linear stability analysis of the $\theta$-Maruyama method applied to these test equations, investigating mean-square and almost sure asymptotic stability of the test equilibria. We discuss the implications of our work for the notion of A-stability of the $\theta$-Maruyama method and use numerical simulation to suggest extensions of our results to test systems with nonnormal drift coefficie},

The concept of numerical stability of deterministic schemes is extended to the stochastic case, and a stochastic analogue of Dahlquist's A-stability is proposed. It is shown that the discretization of the drift term alone controls the A-stability of the whole scheme. The quantitative effect of implicitness upon A-stability is also investigated, and stability regions are given for a family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods with optimal order of convergence.},

The result concerns mean-square stability on a stochastic differential equation test problem with multiplicative noise. The numerical method reduces to the Theta Method on deterministic problems. Saito and Mitsui showed that the deterministic A-stability property of the Theta Method does not carry through to the mean-square context in general, and gave a condition un- der which unconditional stability holds. The main purpose of this note is to emphasize that the approach of Saito and Mitsui makes it possible to quantify precisely the point where unconditional stability is lost in terms of the ratio of the drift (deterministic) and diffusion (stochastic) coefficients. This leads to a concept akin to deterministic A($\alpha$)-stability that may be useful in the stability analysis of more general methods. It is also shown that mean-square A-stability is recovered if the Theta Method parameter is increased beyond its normal range to the value 3/2.},

  Abstract                 = {Stability analysis of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is motivated by the question ``for what choices of stepsize does the numerical method reproduce the characteristics of the test equation? '' We study a linear test equation with a multiplicative noise term, and consider mean-square and asymptotic stability of a stochastic version of the theta method. We extend some mean-square stability results in [Saito and Mitsui, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), pp. 2254--2267]. In particular, we show that an extension of the deterministic A-stability property holds. We also plot mean-square stability regions for the case where the test equation has real parameters. For asymptotic stability, we show that the issue reduces to finding the expected value of a parametrized random variable. We combine analytical and numerical techniques to get insights into the stability properties. For a variant of the method that has been proposed in the literature we obtain precise analytic expressions for the asymptotic stability region. This allows us to prove a number of results. The technique introduced is widely applicable, and we use it to show that a fully implicit method suggested by [Kloeden and Platen, Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, Springer-Verlag, 1992] has an asymptotic stability extension of the deterministic A-stability property. We also use the approach to explain some numerical results},

On the basis of such an approach, for one-dimensional and multidimensional semi- linear transport equations of quite a general form with given initial data and boundary conditions the exact difference schemes (EDSs) are constructed. In the case of constant coefficients, such numerical methods can be created on rectangular grids, while in the case of variable coefficients -- on moving grids only. The questions of developing differ- ence schemes of arbitrary order for quasi-linear transport equations with a nonlinear right-hand side are discussed. In this paper, the EDSs are constructed also for certain classes of linear and quasi- linear parabolic equations, for convection-diffusion problems with a small parameter, as well as inhomogeneous wave equations with constant coefficient},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) represent physical phenomena dominated by stochastic processes. As for deterministic ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various numerical methods are proposed for SDEs. We have proposed two types of numerical stability for SDEs, namely mean-square stability and trajectory stability. However we have considered the analysis for the test equation with multiplicative noise only, but not additive. In this note we will study numerical stability analysis for a test system with additive noise, and will show some results for the Euler-Maruyama method.},
