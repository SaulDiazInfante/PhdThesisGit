  abstract	= {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level
		  Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain
		  setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational
		  complexity needed to compute expected values of functions
		  of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The
		  extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the
		  requisite processes that is easy to simulate while
		  providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and
		  in a stark departure from other implementations of
		  multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased
		  estimator that is significantly less computationally
		  expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from
		  exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We
		  thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the
		  basic computational complexity of current approaches that
		  have many names and variants across the scientific
		  literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm,
		  discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic
		  Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the
		  residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation
		  algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new
		  algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example
		  where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level
		  discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by
		  exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled
		  chemical reaction networks provide a very important
		  application for this work. Hence, we use this context for
		  our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and
		  computational examples.},

		  associated with the development of a destructive osteolytic
		  bone disease. RESULTS: Mathematical models are developed
		  for normal bone remodeling and for the dysregulated bone
		  remodeling that occurs in myeloma bone disease. The models
		  examine the critical signaling between osteoclasts (bone
		  resorption) and osteoblasts (bone formation). The
		  interactions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are modeled as
		  a system of differential equations for these cell
		  populations, which exhibit stable oscillations in the
		  normal case and unstable oscillations in the myeloma case.
		  In the case of untreated myeloma, osteoclasts increase and
		  osteoblasts decrease, with net bone loss as the tumor
		  grows. The therapeutic effects of targeting both myeloma
		  cells and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment on
		  these dynamics are examined. CONCLUSIONS: The current model
		  accurately reflects myeloma bone disease and illustrates
		  how treatment approaches may be investigated using such
		  computational approaches. REVIEWERS: This article was

		  sample paths of the stochastic system are concentrated in a

		  explicitly. Depending on the dynamics of the reduced
		  system, the results cover time spans which can be
		  exponentially long in the noise intensity squared (that is,
		  up to Kramers' time). We obtain exponentially small upper
		  and lower bounds on the probability of exceptional paths.
		  If the slow manifold contains bifurcation points, we show
		  similar concentration properties for the fast variables
		  corresponding to non-bifurcating modes. We also give
		  conditions under which the system can be approximated by a
		  lower-dimensional one, in which the fast variables contain

  abstract	= {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level
		  Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain
		  setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational
		  complexity needed to compute expected values of functions
		  of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The
		  extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the
		  requisite processes that is easy to simulate while
		  providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and
		  in a stark departure from other implementations of
		  multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased
		  estimator that is significantly less computationally
		  expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from
		  exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We
		  thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the
		  basic computational complexity of current approaches that
		  have many names and variants across the scientific
		  literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm,
		  discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic
		  Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the
		  residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation
		  algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new
		  algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example
		  where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level
		  discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by
		  exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled
		  chemical reaction networks provide a very important
		  application for this work. Hence, we use this context for
		  our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and

  abstract	= {Biofilm forming microbes have complex effects on the flow
		  properties of natural porous media. Subsurface biofilms
		  have the potential for the formation of biobarriers to
		  inhibit contaminant migration in groundwater. Another
		  example of beneficial microbial effects is the
		  biotransformation of organic contaminants to less harmful
		  forms, thereby providing an in situ method for treatment of
		  contaminated groundwater supplies. Mathematical models that
		  describe contaminant transport with biodegradation involve
		  a set of coupled convection-dispersion equations with
		  non-linear reactions. The reactive solute transport
		  equation is one for which numerical solution procedures
		  continue to exhibit significant limitations for certain
		  problems of groundwater hydrology interest. Accurate
		  numerical simulations are crucial to the development of
		  contaminant remediation strategies. A new numerical method
		  is developed for simulation of reactive bacterial transport
		  in porous media. The non-standard numerical approach is
		  based on the ideas of the 'exact' time-stepping scheme. It
		  leads to solutions free from the numerical instabilities
		  that arise from incorrect modeling of derivatives and
		  reaction terms. Applications to different biofilm models
		  are examined and numerical results are presented to
		  demonstrate the performance of the proposed new method.},

  abstract	= {This paper serves as an introductory review of Brownian
		  Dynamics (BD), Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo
		  (MC) modeling techniques. These three simulation methods
		  have proven to be exceptional investigative solutions for
		  probing discrete molecular, ionic, and colloidal motions at
		  their basic microscopic levels. The review offers a general
		  study of the classical theories and algorithms that are
		  foundational to Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and
		  Monte Carlo simulations. Important topics of interest
		  include fundamental theories that govern Brownian motion,
		  the Langevin equation, the Verlet algorithm, and the
		  Metropolis method. Brownian Dynamics demonstrates
		  advantages over Molecular Dynamics as pertaining to the
		  issue of time-scale separation. Monte Carlo methods exhibit
		  strengths in terms of ease of implementation. Hybrid
		  techniques that combine these methods and draw from these
		  efficacies are also presented. With their rigorous
		  microscopic approach, Brownian Dynamics, Molecular
		  Dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods prove to be especially
		  viable modeling methods for problems with challenging
		  complexities such as high-level particle concentration and
		  multiple particle interactions. These methods hold
		  promising potential for effective modeling of transport in
		  colloidal systems.},

  abstract	= {Generating sample paths of stochastic differential
		  equations (SDE) using the Monte Carlo method finds wide
		  applications in financial engineering. Discretization is a
		  popular approximate approach to generating those paths: it
		  is easy to implement but prone to simulation bias. This
		  article presents a new simulation scheme to exactly
		  generate samples for SDEs. The key observation is that the
		  law of a general SDE can be decomposed into a product of
		  the law of standard Brownian motion and the law of a doubly
		  stochastic Poisson process. An acceptance-rejection
		  algorithm is devised based on the combination of this
		  decomposition and a localization technique. The numerical
		  results corroborates that the mean-square error of the
		  proposed method is in the order of O(t−1/2), which is
		  superior to the conventional discretization schemes.
		  Furthermore, the proposed method also can generate exact
		  samples for SDE with boundaries which the discretization
		  schemes usually find difficulty in dealing with.},

  abstract	= {The recently presented Brownian dynamics model for
		  superhelical DNA is extended to include local curvature of
		  the DNA helix axis. Here we analyze the effect of a
		  permanent bend on the structure and dynamics of an 1870-bp
		  superhelix with delta Lk = -10. Furthermore, we define
		  quantitative expressions for computing structural
		  parameters such as loop positions, superhelix diameter, and
		  plectonemic content for trajectories of superhelical DNA,
		  and assess the convergence toward global equilibrium. The
		  structural fluctuations in an interwound superhelix, as
		  reflected in the change in end loop positions, seem to
		  occur by destruction/creation of loops rather than by a
		  sliding motion of the DNA around its contour. Their time
		  scale is on the order of 30-100 microseconds. A permanent
		  bend changes the structure and the internal motions of the
		  DNA drastically. The position of the end loop is fixed at
		  the permanent bend, and the local motions of the chain are
		  enhanced near the loops. A displacement of the bend from
		  the end loop to a position inside the plectonemic part of
		  the superhelix results in the formation of a new loop and
		  the disappearance of the old one; we estimate the time
		  involved in this process to be about 0.5 ms.},

		  The importance of carefully tuning the simulation
		  parameters to correctly resolve the multiple time and
		  length-scales of this problem is emphasized. We
		  systematically analyze how our coarse-graining scheme
		  resolves dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers such as the
		  Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, the Mach number, the
		  Knudsen number, and the Peclet number. The many Brownian
		  and hydrodynamic time-scales can be telescoped together to
		  maximize computational efficiency while still correctly
		  resolving the physically relevant physical processes. We
		  also show how to control a number of numerical artifacts,
		  such as finite size effects and solvent induced attractive
		  depletion interactions. When all these considerations are
		  properly taken into account, the measured colloidal
		  velocity auto-correlation functions and related self
		  diffusion and friction coefficients compare quantitatively
		  with theoretical calculations. By contrast, these
		  calculations demonstrate that, notwithstanding its
		  seductive simplicity, the basic Langevin equation does a
		  remarkably poor job of capturing the decay rate of the

		  p. 149]; we prove the nonnegative character of its
		  solutions for the corresponding backward Kolmogorov
		  differential equation; we propose a finite element method,

@Article{	  delay2005,
  abstract	= {Since the first attempts some 20 yr ago in the field of
		  hydrology, random walk (RW) particle tracking as applied to
		  solute transport has experienced profound changes. Concepts
		  and mathematical techniques have improved to the point that
		  numerically difficult problems (e.g., advection-dominated
		  transport in highly heterogeneous media, or reactive
		  transport) are now much easier to address. Random walk has
		  never been widely used for multiphase flow, probably
		  because numerical dispersion is not a major problem for
		  modeling exercises at large scales. However, vadose zone
		  hydrologic studies often point out very strong variations
		  in fluid velocity over relatively short distances. Random
		  walk methods may be well suited for such studies, a
		  possibility which motivated us to write this review. We
		  first give a comprehensive discussion of the theoretical
		  context of the method. The Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov
		  equation (FPKE) is established for solute transport, as
		  well as the ordinary Langevin equation and its
		  simplifications for transport of small particles (e.g.,
		  colloids). Next, numerical methods are developed for the
		  motion of particles in space. An important section is
		  subsequently dedicated to recent RW concepts in the time
		  domain, and to their application to anomalous (non-Fickian)
		  transport and inverse problems. Adaptations of RW to
		  transport with solute-solid reactions are also provided, as
		  well as several numerical recipes for resolving a few
		  computational difficulties with the RW method. We purposely
		  did not include any comparisons with Eulerian and
		  Lagrangian approaches. These approaches are discussed at
		  length in several references cited in this review. We note,
		  however, that today's computing capabilities provide new
		  incentives to using RW methods for problems where Eulerian
		  methods are potentially unstable or hampered by numerical
		  diffusion.},

@Article{	  dobrinevski2012,
  abstract	= {Populations of competing biological species exhibit a
		  fascinating interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of
		  evolutionary selection forces and random fluctuations
		  arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The
		  processes leading to extinction of species, whose
		  understanding is a key component in the study of evolution
		  and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors.
		  In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic
		  population dynamics models based on generalized
		  Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of
		  the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic
		  noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys
		  coexistence of interacting species on a time scale
		  proportional to the population size. We introduce a new
		  method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to
		  understand this extinction process quantitatively by
		  reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This
		  is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models
		  and can be generalized numerically to more complex
		  situations. The extinction probability distributions and
		  other quantities of interest we obtain show excellent
		  agreement with simulations.},

  abstract	= {Existence of solutions for a class of doubly nonlinear
		  evolution equations of second order is proven by studying a
		  full discretization. The discretization combines a time
		  stepping on a non- uniform time grid, which generalizes the
		  well-known St¨ ormer–Verlet scheme, with an internal
		  approximation scheme. The linear operator acting on the
		  zero-order term is supposed to induce an inner product,
		  whereas the nonlinear time-dependent operator acting on the
		  first-order time derivative is as- sumed to be
		  hemicontinuous, monotone and coercive (up to some additive
		  shift), and to fulfill a certain growth condition. The
		  analysis also extends to the case of additional nonlinear
		  per- turbations of both the operators, provided the
		  perturbations satisfy a certain growth and a lo- cal H¨
		  older-type continuity condition. A priori estimates are
		  then derived in abstract fractional Sobolev spaces.
		  Convergence in a weak sense is shown for piecewise
		  polynomial prolongations in time of the fully discrete
		  solutions under suitable requirements on the sequence of
		  time grids.},

		  order to study the dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles. The
		  corresponding Langevin-dynamics approach allows for the
		  study of the fluctuating trajectories of individual
		  magnetic moments, where we have encountered remarkable
		  phenomena in the overbarrier rotation process, such as
		  crossing-back or multiple crossing of the potential
		  barrier, rooted in the gyromagnetic nature of the system.
		  Concerning averaged quantities, we study the linear dynamic
		  response of the archetypal ensemble of noninteracting
		  classical magnetic moments with axially symmetric magnetic
		  anisotropy. The results are compared with different
		  analytical expressions used to model the relaxation of
		  nanoparticle ensembles, assessing their accuracy. It has
		  been found that, among a number of heuristic expressions
		  for the linear dynamic susceptibility, only the simple
		  formula proposed by Shliomis and Stepanov matches the
		  coarse features of the susceptibility reasonably. By

  abstract	= {The paper proposes Metropolis adjusted Langevin and
		  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling methods defined on the
		  Riemann manifold to resolve the shortcomings of existing
		  Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from target densities
		  that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong
		  correlations. The methods provide fully automated
		  adaptation mechanisms that circumvent the costly pilot runs
		  that are required to tune proposal densities for
		  Metropolis-Hastings or indeed Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and
		  Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithms. This allows for
		  highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions
		  where different scalings may be required for the transient
		  and stationary phases of the Markov chain. The methodology
		  proposed exploits the Riemann geometry of the parameter
		  space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts
		  to the local structure when simulating paths across this
		  manifold, providing highly efficient convergence and
		  exploration of the target density. The performance of these
		  Riemann manifold Monte Carlo methods is rigorously assessed
		  by performing inference on logistic regression models,
		  log-Gaussian Cox point processes, stochastic volatility
		  models and Bayesian estimation of dynamic systems described
		  by non-linear differential equations. Substantial
		  improvements in the time-normalized effective sample size
		  are reported when compared with alternative sampling

  abstract	= {The structural properties and the single-file diffusion in
		  one-dimensional interacting colloidal systems are studied
		  by means of Brownian dynamics simulations. We consider
		  three types of particle interactions, namely,
		  Weeks-Chandler-Andersen, screened Coulomb, and
		  superparamagnetic potentials. We find that, regardless of
		  the interaction potential, at low densities particles are
		  distributed in a typical fluidlike structure and at higher
		  densities or potential strengths become spatially
		  correlated at long-distances. Particularly, our findings
		  demonstrate that one-dimensional systems, with particles
		  interacting repulsively, show common structural and
		  dynamical behaviors at the boundary in which the degree of
		  ordering changes dramatically; the main peak of the static
		  structure factor becomes highly narrow with a height of
		  S(c)≈7, whereas the reduced mobility factor F, which is
		  associated with the single-file diffusion at long-times or
		  long wavelengths, reaches values F(∗)≈0.1. These
		  features are analyzed and discussed in the context of a
		  local order-disorder transition.},

		  Lipschitz and that the pth moments of the exact and
		  numerical solution are bounded for some p > 2. As an
		  application of this general theory we show that an implicit
		  variant of Euler-Maruyama converges if the diffusion
		  coefficient is globally Lipschitz, but the drift
		  coefficient satisfies only a one-sided Lipschitz condition;
		  this is achieved by showing that the implicit method has
		  bounded moments and may be viewed as an Euler-Maruyama
		  approximation to a perturbed SDE of the same form. Second,
		  we show that the optimal rate of convergence can be
		  recovered if the drift coefficient is also assumed to

  abstract	= {Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations
		  is commonly used in many branches of science. In this paper
		  we present how to accelerate this kind of numerical
		  calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units
		  using the CUDA programming environment. We address general
		  aspects of numerical programming on stream processors and
		  illustrate them by two examples: the noisy phase dynamics
		  in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In
		  presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as
		  675?? compared to a typical CPU, which corresponds to
		  several billion integration steps per second. This means
		  that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in
		  less than one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a
		  completely new level, opening for research a whole new
		  range of problems which can now be solved interactively.

		  language: CUDA C. Computer: any system with a
		  CUDA-compatible GPU. Operating system: Linux. RAM: 64 MB of
		  GPU memory. Classification: 4.3. External routines: The
		  program requires the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit Version 2.0 or
		  newer and the GNU Scientific Library v1.0 or newer.
		  Optionally gnuplot is recommended for quick visualization
		  of the results. Nature of problem: Direct numerical
		  integration of stochastic differential equations is a
		  computationally intensive problem, due to the necessity of
		  calculating multiple independent realizations of the
		  system. We exploit the inherent parallelism of this problem
		  and perform the calculations on GPUs using the CUDA
		  programming environment. The GPU's ability to execute
		  hundreds of threads simultaneously makes it possible to
		  speed up the computation by over two orders of magnitude,
		  compared to a typical modern CPU. Solution method: The
		  stochastic Runge-Kutta method of the second order is
		  applied to integrate the equation of motion.
		  Ensemble-averaged quantities of interest are obtained
		  through averaging over multiple independent realizations of
		  the system. Unusual features: The numerical solution of the
		  stochastic differential equations in question is performed
		  on a GPU using the CUDA environment. Running time: < 1

  abstract	= {The solution of a parabolic stochastic partial
		  differential equation (SPDE) driven by an
		  infinite-dimensional Brownian motion is in general not a
		  semi-martingale anymore and does in general not satisfy an
		  It$\backslash$\^{}\{o\} formula like the solution of a
		  finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary differential
		  equation (SODE). In particular, it is not possible to
		  derive stochastic Taylor expansions as for the solution of
		  a SODE using an iterated application of the
		  It$\backslash$\^{}\{o\} formula. Consequently, until
		  recently, only low order numerical approximation results
		  for such a SPDE have been available. Here, the fact that
		  the solution of a SPDE driven by additive noise can be
		  interpreted in the mild sense with integrals involving the
		  exponential of the dominant linear operator in the SPDE
		  provides an alternative approach for deriving stochastic
		  Taylor expansions for the solution of such a SPDE.
		  Essentially, the exponential factor has a mollifying effect

		  finance, for example, the numerical simulation of extended
		  Libor market models used to value structured interest rate
		  derivatives has to preserve positivity or boundedness of
		  the underlying stochastic processes used to model
		  mean-reverting volatility or forward rates. This paper
		  discusses how stochastic integration schemes can be
		  constructed in order to maintain these properties of the

		  method-of-choice with respect to both efficiency and
		  preservation of structural properties, as they turn out to
		  dominate the increments of Brownian motions. These

  abstract	= {Many stochastic differential equations that occur in
		  financial modelling do not satisfy the standard assumptions
		  made in convergence proofs of numerical schemes that are
		  given in textbooks, i.e., their coefficients and the
		  corresponding derivatives appearing in the proofs are not
		  uniformly bounded and hence, in particular, not globally
		  Lipschitz. Specific examples are the Heston and
		  Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and
		  the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient functions.
		  Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama
		  scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense
		  when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless,
		  new convergence results have been obtained recently for
		  many such models in financial mathematics. These are
		  reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional
		  importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on
		  expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong
		  convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo
		  methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be
		  considered along with methods which preserve the positivity
		  of the solutions.},

@Article{	  knuth1992,
  abstract	= {The author advocates two specific mathematical notations
		  from his popular course and joint textbook, "Concrete
		  Mathematics". The first of these, extending an idea of
		  Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1
		  when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This
		  notation can encourage and clarify the use of
		  characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and
		  integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the
		  same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial
		  coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and
		  read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind
		  should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n
		  cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should
		  be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n
		  partition k".) The written form was first suggested by
		  Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that
		  Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in
		  combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional
		  relations similar to those satisfied by binomial
		  coefficients.},

@Article{	  kowarschik2003,
  abstract	= {In order to mitigate the impact of the growing gap between
		  CPU speed and main memory performance, today’s computer
		  architectures implement hierarchical memory structures. The
		  idea behind this approach is to hide both the low main
		  memory bandwidth and the latency of main memory accesses
		  which is slow in contrast to the floating-point performance
		  of the CPUs. Usually, there is a small and expensive high
		  speed memory sitting on top of the hierarchy which is
		  usually integrated within the processor chip to provide
		  data with low latency and high bandwidth; i.e., the CPU
		  registers. Moving further away from the CPU, the layers of
		  memory successively become larger and slower. The memory
		  components which are located between the processor core and

  abstract	= {The understanding of adaptive algorithms for stochastic
		  differential equations (SDEs) is an open area, where many
		  issues related to both convergence and stability (long-time
		  behaviour) of algorithms are unresolved. This paper
		  considers a very simple adaptive algorithm, based on
		  controlling only the drift component of a time step. Both
		  convergence and stability are studied. The primary issue in
		  the convergence analysis is that the adaptive method does
		  not necessarily drive the time steps to zero with the
		  user-input tolerance. This possibility must be quantified
		  and shown to have low probability. The primary issue in the
		  stability analysis is ergodicity. It is assumed that the
		  noise is nondegenerate, so that the diffusion process is
		  elliptic, and the drift is assumed to satisfy a coercivity
		  condition. The SDE is then geometrically ergodic (averages
		  converge to statistical equilibrium exponentially quickly).
		  If the drift is not linearly bounded, then explicit fixed
		  time step approximations, such as the Euler-Maruyama
		  scheme, may fail to be ergodic. In this work, it is shown
		  that the simple adaptive time-stepping strategy cures this
		  problem. In addition to proving ergodicity, an exponential
		  moment bound is also proved, generalizing a result known to
		  hold for the SDE itself.},

		  dynamics on a submanifold, also sampling exactly the
		  correct canonical measure with constraints. The
		  corresponding numerical methods can be used to sample
		  (without any bias) a probability measure supported by a

  abstract	= {The explicit solution of stochastic differential equations
		  (SDEs) can be found only in a few cases. Therefore, there
		  is a need for accurate numerical approximations that could,
		  for example, enable Monte Carlo Simulations. Convergence
		  and sta- bility of these methods are well understood for
		  SDEs with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Our research
		  focuses on those situations where the coefficients of the
		  underlying SDEs are non-Lipschitzian. It was demonstrated
		  in the literature, (Hutzenthaler and Jentzen 2009; Higham,
		  Mao, and Yuan 2008) that in this case using the classical
		  methods we may fail to obtain numerically computed paths
		  that are accurate for small step-sizes, or to obtain
		  qualitative information about the behaviour of numerical
		  methods over long time intervals. This work addresses both
		  of these issues, giving a customized analysis of the most
		  widely used numer- ical methods. Motivated by existing work
		  (Higham, Mao, and Stuart 2003b) and (Hu 1996) we consider
		  implicit schemes. These authors have demonstrated that a
		  backward Euler-Maruyama method strongly converges to the
		  solution of SDEs with one-sided Lipschitz drift and linear
		  growth diffusion coefficients. We extend their work by
		  allowing for a polynomially growing diffusion term. The
		  strong convergence is valuable as it reveals a pathwise
		  error; new efficient Multi-Level Monte Carlo simulations
		  (Giles 2008; Pages 2007) rely on strong convergence and
		  weak convergence. In addition we examine global almost sure
		  asymptotic stabil- ity in this nonlinear setting. In
		  particular, we present a stochastic counterpart of the
		  discrete LaSalle principle from which we deduce stability
		  properties of im- plicit numerical methods. We also show
		  that an appropriate implicit numerical method preserves
		  positivity. In addition to being a desirable modelling
		  property, in some cases positivity of the numerical
		  approximation is required in order for the scheme to be
		  well defined. Motivation for our work comes from finance
		  and biology where many widely applied models do not satisfy
		  a Lipschitz condition. We support our theoreti- cal results
		  with relevant examples, such as stochastic interest rate
		  models and stochastic volatility models. Although the
		  considered schemes are implicit we point out that in many
		  practical situations they do not increase computational
		  complexity. We provide numerical results in support of our
		  analysis.},

		  partitions of integration time-intervals) to a stochastic
		  differential delay equation (SDDE) share the property of
		  mean-square exponential stability. Our approach is trying
		  to avoid the use of Lyapunov functions or functionals.We
		  show that under a global Lipschitz assumption an SDDE is
		  exponentially stable in mean square if and only if for some

		  method is exponentially stable in mean square. We then
		  replace the global Lipschitz condition with a finite-time

		  it transfers the asymptotic problem into a finite-time
		  convergence problem. Replacing the exact andEMnumerical
		  solution with stochastic processes, we also discuss whether
		  a family of stochastic processes share the stability
		  property. This new approach allows us to discuss (i)
		  whether a family of SDDEs share the stability property, and
		  (ii) whether an SDDE with variable time lag shares
		  stability property with the modifiedEMmethod. As another
		  application of this general approach we consider a linear

@Article{	  mattingly2002a,
  abstract	= {The ergodic properties of SDEs, and various time
		  discretizations for SDEs, are studied. The ergodicity of
		  SDEs is established by using techniques from the theory of
		  Markov chains on general state spaces, such as that
		  expounded by Meyn-Tweedie. Application of these Markov
		  chain results leads to straightforward proofs of geometric
		  ergodicity for a variety of SDEs, including problems with
		  degenerate noise and for problems with locally Lipschitz
		  vector fields. Applications where this theory can be
		  usefully applied include damped-driven Hamiltonian problems
		  (the Langevin equation), the Lorenz equation with
		  degenerate noise and gradient systems. The same Markov
		  chain theory is then used to study time-discrete
		  approximations of these SDEs. The two primary ingredients
		  for ergodicity are a minorization condition and a Lyapunov
		  condition. It is shown that the minorization condition is
		  robust under approximation. For globally Lipschitz vector
		  fields this is also true of the Lyapunov condition. However
		  in the locally Lipschitz case the Lyapunov condition fails
		  for explicit methods such as Euler-Maruyama; for pathwise
		  approximations it is, in general, only inherited by
		  specially constructed implicit discretizations. Examples of
		  such discretization based on backward Euler methods are
		  given, and approximation of the Langevin equation studied
		  in some detail. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

  abstract	= {The ability of numerical methods to reproduce long-time
		  features of a linear stochastic oscillator are examined. It
		  is shown that certain, widely- used, methods fail to
		  capture the correct second moment growth rate, whereas a
		  customized extension of the partitioned Euler method
		  behaves well in this respect. It is also shown that the
		  partitioned Euler method in- herits an infinite-oscillation
		  property. A weaker oscillation result is proved for a wide

  abstract	= {The present paper introduces a new diffusion process for
		  the purpose of modelling logistic-type behaviour patterns.
		  Unlike other processes in the same context, this one
		  verifies that its mean function is a logistic curve. In
		  addition, its transition density can be found explicitly,
		  which allows to analyse inference from the discrete
		  sampling of trajectories. The main features of the process
		  will be analysed and the maximum likelihood estimation of
		  parameters will be carried out through discrete sampling.
		  Regarding the numerical problems found to solve the
		  likelihood equations, several strategies are developed for
		  obtaining initial solutions for the usual numerical
		  procedures. Such strategies are compared by means of a
		  simulation example. Also, another simulation study is
		  carried out in order to compare the estimation in this
		  process to that developed by means of continuous sampling
		  in the logistic diffusion model considered by Giovanis and
		  Skiadas (1999). Finally an example is given for the growth
		  of a microorganism culture. This example illustrates the
		  predictive possibilities of the new process, as well as its
		  ability to study time variables formulated as
		  first-passage-times.},

		  Langevin dynamics, and on different resulting numerical
		  integration schemes. Using a method based on the
		  exponentiation of time dependent operators, we carefully
		  derive a numerical scheme for the Langevin dynamics, which
		  we found equivalent to the proposal of Ermak and Buckholtz
		  [J. Comput. Phys. 35, 169 (1980)] and not simply to the
		  stochastic version of the velocity-Verlet algorithm.
		  However, we checked on numerical simulations that both
		  algorithms give similar results, and share the same "weak
		  order two" accuracy. We then apply the same strategy to
		  derive and test two numerical schemes for the dissipative
		  particle dynamics. The first one of them was found to
		  compare well, in terms of speed and accuracy, with the best
		  currently available algorithms.},

  abstract	= {A simple stochastic mathematical model is developed and
		  investigated for early human immunodeficiency virus type-1
		  (HIV-1) population dynamics. The model, which is a
		  multi-dimensional diffusion process, includes activated
		  uninfected CD4(+)T cells, latently and actively infected
		  CD4(+)T cells and free virions occurring in plasma.
		  Stochastic effects are assumed to arise in the process of
		  infection of CD4(+)T cells and transitions may occur from
		  uninfected to latently or actively infected cells by chance
		  mechanisms. Using the best currently available parameter
		  values, the intrinsic variability in response to a given
		  initial infection is examined by solving the stochastic
		  system numerically. We estimate the statistical
		  distributions of the time of occurrence and the magnitude
		  of the early peak in viral concentration. The maximum of
		  the viral load has a value in the experimental range and
		  its time of occurrence has a 95\% confidence interval from
		  19.4 to 25.1 days. The stochastic nature of the growth of
		  viral density is extremely pronounced in the first few days
		  after initial infection. Threshold effects are noted at
		  virion levels of about 3-5x10(-5) mm-3. In addition to
		  modeling the intrinsic variability in HIV-1 growth, we have
		  explored the effects of perturbations in the parameter
		  values in order to assess the additional stochastic effects
		  of between-patient variability. We found that changes in
		  the initial number of virions or dose size, the rate at
		  which latently infected CD4(+)T cells are converted to the
		  actively infected form and the fraction of latent cells has
		  only minor effects on the size, speed and variability of
		  the response. In contrast, decreased speed and magnitude
		  but greater variability in response were obtained when the
		  death rate of uninfected CD4(+) T cells, the death rate of
		  actively infected cells and the clearance rate of the virus
		  were increased or when the appearance rate of uninfected
		  CD4(+)T cells, the number of virions produced by infected
		  cells, the infection rate of CD4(+)T cells and the initial
		  number of uninfected activated CD4(+)T cells were
		  decreased. We also determined the distribution of the time
		  to reach a given virion density. From this distribution the
		  probability of detection of the virus as a function of time
		  can be estimated. The numerical results obtained are in the
		  range of experimental values and are discussed in relation
		  to recently proposed detection and testing procedures.},

  abstract	= {For stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a
		  superlinearly growing and globally one-sided Lipschitz
		  continuous drift coefficient, the explicit schemes fail to
		  converge strongly to the exact solution. Recently, an
		  explicit strongly convergent numerical scheme, called the
		  tamed Euler method, is proposed in [Hutzenthaler, Jentzen,
		  \& Kloeden (2010); Strong convergence of an explicit
		  numerical method for SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz
		  continuous coefficients, arXiv:1010.3756v1] for such SDEs.
		  Motivated by their work, we here introduce a tamed version
		  of the Milstein scheme for SDEs with commutative noise. The
		  proposed method is also explicit and easily implementable.
		  Moreover, it achieves higher strong order than the tamed
		  Euler method. Note that new difficulties arise in
		  recovering the strong convergence order one and new
		  techniques are developed to overcome them. Finally, an
		  illustrative example confirms the computational efficiency
		  of this explicit numerical scheme compared to the tamed
		  Euler method.},

		  for solving such equations are of low accuracy and poor
		  stability. A general strategy for developing accurate and
		  efficient schemes for solving stochastic equations is
		  outlined here. High-order numerical methods are developed
		  for the integration of stochastic differential equations
		  with strong solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the
		  resulting integration schemes by computing the errors in
		  approximate solutions for SDE's which have known exact
		  solutions.},

  abstract	= {Recently, explicit tamed schemes were proposed to
		  approximate the SDEs with the non-Lipschitz continuous
		  coefficients. This work proposes a semi-tamed Euler scheme,
		  which is also explicit, to solve the SDEs with the drift
		  coefficient equipped with the Lipschitz continuous part and
		  non-Lipschitz continuous part. It is shown that the
		  semi-tamed Euler converges strongly with the standard order
		  one-half to the exact solution of the SDE. We also
		  investigate the stability inheritance of the semi-tamed
		  Euler schemes and reveal that this scheme does have
		  advantage in reproducing the exponential mean square
		  stability of the exact solution. Numerical experiments
		  confirm the theoretical analysis. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All
