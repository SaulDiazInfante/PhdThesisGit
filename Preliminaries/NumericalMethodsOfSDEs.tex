	The topic of this thesis is the development of new numerical solutions for stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SDE}
	dy(t) = f(y(t))dt + g(y(t))dW(t), \qquad t\in [0,T], \qquad y(0)=y_0 .
\end{equation}
	Generally, we know the analytical solution for a few SDEs.
So, we need numerical schemes in order to approximate the solutions of \cref{eqn:SDE}. In this section present  the 
most popular numerical methods for SDEs and also give some fundamental results in numerical analysis of stochastic  
differential equations. We star describing the solutions of SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE}.
	
	Throughout  this  section, we consider the following setup. Let 
$(\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in[0,T]},\mathbb{P})$  a filtered and complete probability space with
the filtration $(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$ generated by the $m$-dimensional Brownian process 
$B_t=( B_t^{(1)}\ldots B_t^{(m)})^T$.
Now we  start by establishing the definition of strong solution and the main theorems of  existence and  uniqueness.

\begin{definition}[Strong Solution]
	The strong solution of  SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE} on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$,
	respect to a fixed Brownian motion $B$ and initial condition $y_0$,
	is a continuous stochastic process $y=\left\{ y(t): 0\leq t<\infty\right\} $
	with the following properties:
	\begin{enumerate}[(SS-1)]
		\item \label{eq:SF1}
			$y$ is adapted to the filtration $\{\calF_{t}\}_{t\in[0,T]}$,
		\item \label{eq:SF2}
			$\prob{[y(0)=y_0]}=1$,
		\item \label{eq:SF3}
		$\displaystyle \prob{\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(s,y(s))+g(s,y(s))ds<\infty\right]=1},$
		\item \label{eq:SF4}
		$
		\displaystyle
			y(t)=y_0+\int_{0}^{t} f(y(s))ds+
		\int_{0}^{t} g(y(s))dB_s
		\qquad \as
		$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
	
Now,  consider SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE} where $y_0$ is a constant, $f$ is a measurable
$d-$vector valued function, $g$ is a measurable $d\times m$-matrix-valued measurable function.
In order to assure a unique solution we suppose the following.
\begin{assumption}\label{ass:ClassicExisAndUniqueness}
		The coefficients of SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE} $f$, $g$ satisfy: 
	\begin{enumerate}[(EU1)]
		\item \emph{Global Lipschitz condition.}
			There is a positive constant $L$ such that
			$$
				|f(x)-f(z)| \vee |g(x)-g(z)|\leq L|x-z|, \qquad \forall x,z \in \R^d.
			$$
		\item \emph{Linear Growth condition}. There is a positive constant $L$ such that
			$$
				|f(x)|^ 2 \vee |g(x)|^ 2 \leq L(1+|x|^2), \qquad \forall x \in \R^d.
			$$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{assumption}
\begin{thm}[Existence and uniqueness of solutions]
	If \Cref{ass:ClassicExisAndUniqueness} holds, then exists a path-wise unique strong solution of the SDE
	\eqref{eqn:SDE} with initial condition $y_0$ on the time-interval $[0, T]$ and
	\begin{equation}
		\sup_{t\in [0,T]} \EX{|y(t)|^2} < \infty.
	\end{equation}
\end{thm}
	Here, path-wise uniqueness means that if $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ are two solutions of SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE}, then
	$$
		\probX{
			\sup_{t\in [0,T]}
				|x(t)-y(t)|=0
			}=1.
	$$
	It is worth mentioning that  there exist a unique solution even when the linear growth conditions are removed, in
\cite{Higham2002b}, the authors have derived a existence and uniqueness result that depend on a weaker
continuity condition on $f$ and $g$ than the Lipschitz condition. In chapter 4 we well explore this ideas.
Notice that we need to  assure  existence and uniqueness of the solution  of  SDE (2.1)  in order to justify the 
development of a numerical approximation.  Assuming that,  we now propose several numerical approximations for  this 
SDE.
