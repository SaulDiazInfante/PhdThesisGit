		In this paper, we develop a new  numerical method with asymptotic stability
	properties for solving stochastic differential equations (SDEs).  The foundations
	for the  new  solver are the Steklov mean and an exact discretization for the
	deterministic version of  the SDEs. Strong consistency and  convergence properties are
	demonstrated for the proposed  method. Moreover, a rigorous  linear and nonlinear
	asymptotic stability analysis  is  carried out for the multiplicative case in a
	mean-square sense and  for the additive case  in a path-wise sense using the pullback
	limit. In order to emphasize the characteristics  of the Steklov discretization  we
	use as benchmarks the stochastic logistic equation  and  the Langevin equation with a
	nonlinear potential of the Brownian dynamics. We show that  the Steklov method has
	mild stability requirements and allows long-time simulations in  several applications.
