\section{Conclusions}\label{sec6}
In this paper we have constructed a new method, the explicit Steklov scheme, for the
approximation of stochastic differential equations. We have proved strong consistency and
convergence for this scheme. A linear stability study  of the new scheme has been
performed. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for the nonlinear asymptotic stability
in both multiplicative and additive cases. Finally, we showed the behavior of the explicit
Steklov method for  problems  with stringent stability requirements as the logistic
stochastic equation and the Langevin equation in Brownian dynamics. In all these studies,
we established that the Steklov method is an accurate scheme for  large time scales
simulation. Future work will focus on the construction and study  of the implicit Steklov
scheme as well as its possible extension to stochastic differential systems.
