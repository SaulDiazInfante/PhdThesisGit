We work with a standard multidimensional setup, that is,  $y(t)\in \R^d$ for each 
$t$ and  $W(t)$ is a
$m$-dimensional standard Brownian motion on a filtered and complete probability space
$	(
		\Omega ,\calF,(\calF_t)_{t\in[0,T]},\prob{}
	)$,
with the filtration
$(\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\in[0,T]}$  generated by the Brownian process.  Moreover, the complement of a set $E$ is denoted by 
$E^c$ and the indicator function  of the set $E$ is denoted by $\1{E}$. 


We recall that the following set of hypotheses assure existence 
and uniqueness of the solution of the stochastic differential system \eqref{eqn:SDE1} 
and a explicit bound for its moments, see \Cref{thm:MaoCoercive} and \Cref{lem:MomentBound}.

	
\begin{hypothesis}\label[hypothesis]{ass:OSLC}
	The coefficients of SDE \eqref{eqn:SDE1} satisfy the conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}[({H}-1)]
		\item \label{ass:C1Functions}
		The functions $f,g$ are in the class $C^{1}(\R^d)$.
		\item
		\textbf{Local, global Lipschitz condition}. For each integer $n$, there is a positive
		constant $L_{f}=L_{f}(n)$ such that
		$$
		|f(u)-f(v)|^2 %\vee |g(x)-g(y)|^2
		\leq L_{f}|u-v|^2 \qquad \forall u,v \in \R^d, \qquad |u|\vee|v|\leq n,
		$$
		and there is a positive constant $L_g$ such that
		$$
		|g(u)-g(v)|^2 \leq L_{g}|u-v|^2,
		\qquad  \forall u,v \in \R^d.
		$$ 
		\item\label{ass:MonotoneCondition}
		\textbf{Monotone condition.} There exist two positive constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$
		such that
		\begin{equation}\label{eqn:MonotoneCondition}
		\innerprod{u}{f(u)} +\frac{1}{2}|g(u)|^2
		\leq \alpha +\beta |u|^2, \qquad \forall u \in \R^d.
		\end{equation}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{hypothesis}

	This chapter is organized as follows: In \cref{sec:LSConstruction}, we construct the new explicit method and prove 
the always existence of a succession of the Linear Steklov approximation as well as local Lipschitz conditions for
its coefficients.  In \cref{sec:LSStrongConvergence}, we prove the strong convergence of the LS method with one-half
order using the Higham, Stuart and Mao (HSM) technique and in \cref{sec:LSNumericalResults}, its convergence rate is 
obtained. In \cref{sec:LSNumericalResults}, we analyze numerically the accuracy and efficiency of 
the proposed method applied to stochastic differential equations with super-linear growth and locally Lipschitz 
coefficients.
