  Abstract                 = {The role of stochasticity and its interplay with nonlinearity are central current issues in studies of the complex population patterns observed in nature, including the pronounced oscillations of wildlife and infectious diseases. The dynamics of childhood diseases have provided influential case studies to develop and test mathematical models with practical application to epidemiology, but are also of general relevance to the central question of whether simple nonlinear systems can explain and predict the complex temporal and spatial patterns observed in nature outside laboratory conditions. Here, we present a stochastic theory for the major dynamical transitions in epidemics from regular to irregular cycles, which relies on the discrete nature of disease transmission and low spatial coupling. The full spectrum of stochastic fluctuations is derived analytically to show how the amplification of noise varies across these transitions. The changes in noise amplification and coherence appear robust to seasonal forcing, questioning the role of seasonality and its interplay with deterministic components of epidemiological models. Childhood diseases are shown to fall into regions of parameter space of high noise amplification. This type of "endogenous" stochastic resonance may be relevant to population oscillations in nonlinear ecological systems in general.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how to extend a recently proposed multi-level Monte Carlo approach to the continuous time Markov chain setting, thereby greatly lowering the computational complexity needed to compute expected values of functions of the state of the system to a specified accuracy. The extension is non-trivial, exploiting a coupling of the requisite processes that is easy to simulate while providing a small variance for the estimator. Further, and in a stark departure from other implementations of multi-level Monte Carlo, we show how to produce an unbiased estimator that is significantly less computationally expensive than the usual unbiased estimator arising from exact algorithms in conjunction with crude Monte Carlo. We thereby dramatically improve, in a quantifiable manner, the basic computational complexity of current approaches that have many names and variants across the scientific literature, including the Bortz-Kalos-Lebowitz algorithm, discrete event simulation, dynamic Monte Carlo, kinetic Monte Carlo, the n-fold way, the next reaction method,the residence-time algorithm, the stochastic simulation algorithm, Gillespie's algorithm, and tau-leaping. The new algorithm applies generically, but we also give an example where the coupling idea alone, even without a multi-level discretization, can be used to improve efficiency by exploiting system structure. Stochastically modeled chemical reaction networks provide a very important application for this work. Hence, we use this context for our notation, terminology, natural scalings, and computational examples.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy associated with the development of a destructive osteolytic bone disease. RESULTS: Mathematical models are developed for normal bone remodeling and for the dysregulated bone remodeling that occurs in myeloma bone disease. The models examine the critical signaling between osteoclasts (bone resorption) and osteoblasts (bone formation). The interactions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts are modeled as a system of differential equations for these cell populations, which exhibit stable oscillations in the normal case and unstable oscillations in the myeloma case. In the case of untreated myeloma, osteoclasts increase and osteoblasts decrease, with net bone loss as the tumor grows. The therapeutic effects of targeting both myeloma cells and cells of the bone marrow microenvironment on these dynamics are examined. CONCLUSIONS: The current model accurately reflects myeloma bone disease and illustrates how treatment approaches may be investigated using such computational approaches. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Ariosto Silva and Mark P. Little.},

  Abstract                 = {The following question is addressed: under what conditions can a strange diffusive process, defined by a semi-dynamical V-Langevin equation or its associated Hybrid kinetic equation (HKE), be described by an equivalent purely stochastic process, defined by a Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) or by a Fractional Differential Equation (FDE)? More specifically, does there exist a class of V-Langevin equations with long-range (algebraic) velocity temporal correlation, that leads to a time-fractional superdiffusive process? The answer is always affirmative in one dimension. It is always negative in two dimensions: any algebraically decaying temporal velocity correlation (with a Gaussian spatial correlation) produces a normal diffusive process. General conditions relating the diffusive nature of the process to the temporal exponent of the Lagrangian velocity correlation (in Corrsin approximation) are derived.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider slow-fast systems of differential equations, in which both the slow and fast variables are perturbed by noise. When the deterministic system admits a uniformly asymptotically stable slow manifold, we show that the sample paths of the stochastic system are concentrated in a neighbourhood of the slow manifold, which we construct explicitly. Depending on the dynamics of the reduced system, the results cover time spans which can be exponentially long in the noise intensity squared (that is, up to Kramers' time). We obtain exponentially small upper and lower bounds on the probability of exceptional paths. If the slow manifold contains bifurcation points, we show similar concentration properties for the fast variables corresponding to non-bifurcating modes. We also give conditions under which the system can be approximated by a lower-dimensional one, in which the fast variables contain only bifurcating modes.},

We introduce the technique of multiple time-scales to derive the Fokker–Planck equation for a single, or for a set of interacting Brownian particles, start- ing from the Liouville equation for the full system (Brownian particles and discrete bath). The limitations of the Fokker–Planck equation will then be emphasized. In particular, we shall point out that under “standard” experimental conditions, the Fokker–Planck description cannot be correct and that non-Markovian effects are expected. A microscopic description in the true experimental limit confirms this breakdown and leads to a "gen- eralized" (non-Markovian and non-local in velocity space) Fokker–Planck equation, which describes the thermalization of the Brownian particle.},

  Abstract                 = {The Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (MALA), originally introduced to sample exactly the invariant measure of certain stochastic differential equations (SDE) on infinitely long time intervals, can also be used to approximate pathwise the solution of these SDEs on finite time intervals. However, when applied to an SDE with a nonglobally Lipschitz drift coefficient, the algorithm may not have a spectral gap even when the SDE does. This paper reconciles MALA's lack of a spectral gap with its ergodicity to the invariant measure of the SDE and finite time accuracy. In particular, the paper shows that its convergence to equilibrium happens at exponential rate up to terms exponentially small in time-stepsize. This quantification relies on MALA's ability to exactly preserve the SDE's invariant measure and accurately represent the SDE's transition probability on finite time intervals.},

  Abstract                 = {The modelling of many real life phenomena for which either the parameter estima- tion is difficult, or which are subject to randomnoisy perturbations, is often carried out by using stochastic ordinary differential equations (SODEs). For this reason, in recent years much attention has been devoted to deriving numerical methods for approximat- ing their solution. In particular, in this paper we consider the use of linear multistep formulae (LMF). Strong order convergence conditions up to order 1 are stated, for both commutative and non-commutative problems. The case of additive noise is fur- ther investigated, in order to obtain order improvements. The implementation of the methods is also considered, leading to a predictor-corrector approach. Some numerical tests on problems taken from the literature are also included.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a new class of numerical schemes for the pathwise approximation of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The proposed family of strong predictor-corrector Euler methods are designed to handle scenario simulation of solutions of SDEs. It has the potential to overcome some of the numerical instabilities that are often experienced when using the explicit Euler method. This is of importance, for instance, in finance where martingale dynamics arise for solutions of SDEs with multiplicative diffusion coefficients. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved asymptotic stability properties of the new symmetric predictor- corrector Euler methods.},

As in deterministic numerical analysis we use a linear time-invariant test equation and perform a linear stability analysis. Standard approaches used either to analyse deterministic multi-step methods or stochastic one-step methods do not carry over to stochasticmulti-step schemes. In order to obtain sufficient conditions for asymp-totic mean-square stability of stochastic linear two-step-Maruyama methods we con-struct and apply Lyapunov-type functionals.

  Abstract                 = {In this article we compare the mean-square stability properties of the Theta-Maruyama and Theta-Milstein method that are used to solve stochastic differential equations. For the linear stability analysis, we propose an extension of the standard geometric Brownian motion as a test equation and consider a scalar linear test equation with several multiplicative noise terms. This test equation allows to begin investigating the influence of multi-dimensional noise on the stability behaviour of the methods while the analysis is still tractable. Our findings include: (i) the stability condition for the Theta-Milstein method and thus, for some choices of Theta, the conditions on the step-size, are much more restrictive than those for the Theta-Maruyama method; (ii) the precise stability region of the Theta-Milstein method explicitly depends on the noise terms. Further, we investigate the effect of introducing partially implicitness in the diffusion approximation terms of Milstein-type methods, thus obtaining the possibility to control the stability properties of these methods with a further method parameter Sigma. Numerical examples illustrate the results and provide a comparison of the stability behaviour of the different methods.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we extend the ideas of Brugnano, Iavernaro and Trigiante in their development of HBVM (s,r) methods to construct symplectic Runge–Kutta methods for all values of s and r with s≥r. However, these methods do not see the dramatic performance improvement that HBVMs can attain. Nevertheless, in the case of additive stochastic Hamiltonian problems an extension of these ideas, which requires the simulation of an independent Wiener process at each stage of a Runge–Kutta method, leads to methods that have very favourable properties. These ideas are illustrated by some simple numerical tests for the modified midpoint rule.},

  Abstract                 = {We seek numerical methods for second-order stochastic differential equations that reproduce the stationary density accurately for all values of damping. A complete analysis is possible for scalar linear second-order equations (damped harmonic oscillators with additive noise), where the statistics are Gaussian and can be calculated exactly in the continuous-time and discrete-time cases. A matrix equation is given for the stationary variances and correlation for methods using one Gaussian random variable per timestep. The only Runge–Kutta method with a nonsingular tableau matrix that gives the exact steady state density for all values of damping is the implicit midpoint rule. Numerical experiments, comparing the implicit midpoint rule with Heun and leapfrog methods on nonlinear equations with additive or multiplicative noise, produce behavior similar to the linear case},

  Abstract                 = {This paper serves as an introductory review of Brownian Dynamics (BD), Molecular Dynamics (MD), and Monte Carlo (MC) modeling techniques. These three simulation methods have proven to be exceptional investigative solutions for probing discrete molecular, ionic, and colloidal motions at their basic microscopic levels. The review offers a general study of the classical theories and algorithms that are foundational to Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. Important topics of interest include fundamental theories that govern Brownian motion, the Langevin equation, the Verlet algorithm, and the Metropolis method. Brownian Dynamics demonstrates advantages over Molecular Dynamics as pertaining to the issue of time-scale separation. Monte Carlo methods exhibit strengths in terms of ease of implementation. Hybrid techniques that combine these methods and draw from these efficacies are also presented. With their rigorous microscopic approach, Brownian Dynamics, Molecular Dynamics, and Monte Carlo methods prove to be especially viable modeling methods for problems with challenging complexities such as high-level particle concentration and multiple particle interactions. These methods hold promising potential for effective modeling of transport in colloidal systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Generating sample paths of stochastic differential equations (SDE) using the Monte Carlo method finds wide applications in financial engineering. Discretization is a popular approximate approach to generating those paths: it is easy to implement but prone to simulation bias. This article presents a new simulation scheme to exactly generate samples for SDEs. The key observation is that the law of a general SDE can be decomposed into a product of the law of standard Brownian motion and the law of a doubly stochastic Poisson process. An acceptance-rejection algorithm is devised based on the combination of this decomposition and a localization technique. The numerical results corroborates that the mean-square error of the proposed method is in the order of O(t−1/2), which is superior to the conventional discretization schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method also can generate exact samples for SDE with boundaries which the discretization schemes usually find difficulty in dealing with.},

  Abstract                 = {Biofilm forming microbes have complex effects on the flow properties of natural porous media. Subsurface biofilms have the potential for the formation of biobarriers to inhibit contaminant migration in groundwater. Another example of beneficial microbial effects is the biotransformation of organic contaminants to less harmful forms, thereby providing an in situ method for treatment of contaminated groundwater supplies. Mathematical models that describe contaminant transport with biodegradation involve a set of coupled convection-dispersion equations with non-linear reactions. The reactive solute transport equation is one for which numerical solution procedures continue to exhibit significant limitations for certain problems of groundwater hydrology interest. Accurate numerical simulations are crucial to the development of contaminant remediation strategies. A new numerical method is developed for simulation of reactive bacterial transport in porous media. The non-standard numerical approach is based on the ideas of the 'exact' time-stepping scheme. It leads to solutions free from the numerical instabilities that arise from incorrect modeling of derivatives and reaction terms. Applications to different biofilm models are examined and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed new method.},

  Abstract                 = {The recently presented Brownian dynamics model for superhelical DNA is extended to include local curvature of the DNA helix axis. Here we analyze the effect of a permanent bend on the structure and dynamics of an 1870-bp superhelix with delta Lk = -10. Furthermore, we define quantitative expressions for computing structural parameters such as loop positions, superhelix diameter, and plectonemic content for trajectories of superhelical DNA, and assess the convergence toward global equilibrium. The structural fluctuations in an interwound superhelix, as reflected in the change in end loop positions, seem to occur by destruction/creation of loops rather than by a sliding motion of the DNA around its contour. Their time scale is on the order of 30-100 microseconds. A permanent bend changes the structure and the internal motions of the DNA drastically. The position of the end loop is fixed at the permanent bend, and the local motions of the chain are enhanced near the loops. A displacement of the bend from the end loop to a position inside the plectonemic part of the superhelix results in the formation of a new loop and the disappearance of the old one; we estimate the time involved in this process to be about 0.5 ms.},

We show that our methodology can be easily implemented with B-splines, and performs well in a finite sample situation, through Monte Carlo simulations},

  Abstract                 = {An approach for the construction of A-stable high order explicit strong schemes for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with additive noise is proposed. We prove that such schemes also have the dynamical property that we call Random A-stability (RA-stability), which ensures that, for linear equations with stationary so- lutions, the numerical scheme has a random attractor that converges to the exact one as the step size decreases. Basically, the proposed integrators are obtained by split- ting, at each time step, the solution of the original equation into two parts: the solution of a linear ordinary differential equation plus the solution of an auxiliary SDE. The first one is solved by the Local Linearization scheme in such a way that A-stability is guaranteed, while the second one is approximated by any extant scheme, preferably an explicit one that yields high order of convergence with low computational cost. Numerical integrators constructed in this way are called High Order Local Linearization (HOLL) methods. Various efficient HOLL schemes are elaborated in detail, and their performance is illustrated through computer simulations. Furthermore, mean- square convergence of the introduced methods is studied.},

In contrast to Platen's method, which to the knowledge of the author has been up to now the only known third order Runge-Kutta scheme for weak approximation, the new class of methods affords less random variable evaluations and is also applicable to SDEs with multidimensional noise. Order conditions up to order three are calculated and coefficients of a four stage third order method are given. This method has deterministic order four and minimized error constants, and needs in addition less function evaluations than the method of Platen. Applied to some examples, the new method is compared numerically with Platen's method and some well known second order methods and yields very promising results.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the first attempts some 20 yr ago in the field of hydrology, random walk (RW) particle tracking as applied to solute transport has experienced profound changes. Concepts and mathematical techniques have improved to the point that numerically difficult problems (e.g., advection-dominated transport in highly heterogeneous media, or reactive transport) are now much easier to address. Random walk has never been widely used for multiphase flow, probably because numerical dispersion is not a major problem for modeling exercises at large scales. However, vadose zone hydrologic studies often point out very strong variations in fluid velocity over relatively short distances. Random walk methods may be well suited for such studies, a possibility which motivated us to write this review. We first give a comprehensive discussion of the theoretical context of the method. The Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation (FPKE) is established for solute transport, as well as the ordinary Langevin equation and its simplifications for transport of small particles (e.g., colloids). Next, numerical methods are developed for the motion of particles in space. An important section is subsequently dedicated to recent RW concepts in the time domain, and to their application to anomalous (non-Fickian) transport and inverse problems. Adaptations of RW to transport with solute-solid reactions are also provided, as well as several numerical recipes for resolving a few computational difficulties with the RW method. We purposely did not include any comparisons with Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches. These approaches are discussed at length in several references cited in this review. We note, however, that today's computing capabilities provide new incentives to using RW methods for problems where Eulerian methods are potentially unstable or hampered by numerical diffusion.},

  Abstract                 = {Populations of competing biological species exhibit a fascinating interplay between the nonlinear dynamics of evolutionary selection forces and random fluctuations arising from the stochastic nature of the interactions. The processes leading to extinction of species, whose understanding is a key component in the study of evolution and biodiversity, are influenced by both of these factors. In this paper, we investigate a class of stochastic population dynamics models based on generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. In the case of neutral stability of the underlying deterministic model, the impact of intrinsic noise on the survival of species is dramatic: it destroys coexistence of interacting species on a time scale proportional to the population size. We introduce a new method based on stochastic averaging which allows one to understand this extinction process quantitatively by reduction to a lower-dimensional effective dynamics. This is performed analytically for two highly symmetrical models and can be generalized numerically to more complex situations. The extinction probability distributions and other quantities of interest we obtain show excellent agreement with simulations.},

The linear operator acting on the zero-order term is supposed to induce an inner product, whereas the nonlinear time-dependent operator acting on the first-order time derivative is as- sumed to be hemicontinuous, monotone and coercive (up to some additive shift), and to fulfill a certain growth condition. The analysis also extends to the case of additional nonlinear per- turbations of both the operators, provided the perturbations satisfy a certain growth and a lo- cal H¨ older-type continuity condition. A priori estimates are then derived in abstract fractional Sobolev spaces. Convergence in a weak sense is shown for piecewise polynomial prolongations in time of the fully discrete solutions under suitable requirements on the sequence of time grids.},

The corresponding Langevin-dynamics approach allows for the study of the fluctuating trajectories of individual magnetic moments, where we have encountered remarkable phenomena in the overbarrier rotation process, such as crossing-back or multiple crossing of the potential barrier, rooted in the gyromagnetic nature of the system. Concerning averaged quantities, we study the linear dynamic response of the archetypal ensemble of noninteracting classical magnetic moments with axially symmetric magnetic anisotropy. The results are compared with different analytical expressions used to model the relaxation of nanoparticle ensembles, assessing their accuracy. It has been found that, among a number of heuristic expressions for the linear dynamic susceptibility, only the simple formula proposed by Shliomis and Stepanov matches the coarse features of the susceptibility reasonably.

  Abstract                 = {A collection of subroutines and examples of their uses, as well as the underlying numerical methods, are described for generating orthogonal polynomials relative to arbitrary weight functions. The object of these routines is to produce the coefficients in the three-term recurrence relation satisfied by the orthogonal polynomials. Once these are known, additional data can be generated, such as zeros of orthogonal polynomials and Gauss-type quadrature rules, for which routines are also provided.},

The concept of numerical stability of deterministic schemes is extended to the stochastic case, and a stochastic analogue of Dahlquist's A-stability is proposed. It is shown that the discretization of the drift term alone controls the A-stability of the whole scheme. The quantitative effect of implicitness upon A-stability is also investigated, and stability regions are given for a family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods with optimal order of convergence.},

  Abstract                 = {The structural properties and the single-file diffusion in one-dimensional interacting colloidal systems are studied by means of Brownian dynamics simulations. We consider three types of particle interactions, namely, Weeks-Chandler-Andersen, screened Coulomb, and superparamagnetic potentials. We find that, regardless of the interaction potential, at low densities particles are distributed in a typical fluidlike structure and at higher densities or potential strengths become spatially correlated at long-distances. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that one-dimensional systems, with particles interacting repulsively, show common structural and dynamical behaviors at the boundary in which the degree of ordering changes dramatically; the main peak of the static structure factor becomes highly narrow with a height of S(c)≈7, whereas the reduced mobility factor F, which is associated with the single-file diffusion at long-times or long wavelengths, reaches values F(∗)≈0.1. These features are analyzed and discussed in the context of a local order-disorder transition.},

The result concerns mean-square stability on a stochastic differential equation test problem with multiplicative noise. The numerical method reduces to the Theta Method on deterministic problems. Saito and Mitsui showed that the deterministic A-stability property of the Theta Method does not carry through to the mean-square context in general, and gave a condition un- der which unconditional stability holds. The main purpose of this note is to emphasize that the approach of Saito and Mitsui makes it possible to quantify precisely the point where unconditional stability is lost in terms of the ratio of the drift (deterministic) and diffusion (stochastic) coefficients. This leads to a concept akin to deterministic A($\alpha$)-stability that may be useful in the stability analysis of more general methods. It is also shown that mean-square A-stability is recovered if the Theta Method parameter is increased beyond its normal range to the value 3/2.},

  Abstract                 = {Stability analysis of numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is motivated by the question “for what choices of stepsize does the numerical method reproduce the characteristics of the test equation? ” We study a linear test equation with a multiplicative noise term, and consider mean-square and asymptotic stability of a stochastic version of the theta method. We extend some mean-square stability results in [Saito and Mitsui, SIAM. J. Numer. Anal., 33 (1996), pp. 2254–2267]. In particular, we show that an extension of the deterministic A-stability property holds. We also plot mean-square stability regions for the case where the test equation has real parameters. For asymptotic stability, we show that the issue reduces to finding the expected value of a parametrized random variable. We combine analytical and numerical techniques to get insights into the stability properties. For a variant of the method that has been proposed in the literature we obtain precise analytic expressions for the asymptotic stability region. This allows us to prove a number of results. The technique introduced is widely applicable, and we use it to show that a fully implicit method suggested by [Kloeden and Platen, Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations, Springer-Verlag, 1992] has an asymptotic stability extension of the deterministic A-stability property. We also use the approach to explain some numerical results},

  Abstract                 = {Relatively little is known about the ability of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to reproduce almost sure and small-moment stability. Here, we focus on these stability properties in the limit as the timestep tends to zero. Our analysis is motivated by an example of an exponentially almost surely stable nonlinear SDE for which the Euler–Maruyama (EM) method fails to reproduce this behavior for any nonzero timestep. We begin by showing that EM correctly reproduces almost sure and small-moment exponential stability for sufficiently small timesteps on scalar linear SDEs. We then generalize our results to multidimensional nonlinear SDEs. We show that when the SDE obeys a linear growth condition, EM recovers almost surely exponential stability very well. Under the less restrictive condition that the drift coefficient of the SDE obeys a one-sided Lipschitz condition, where EM may break down, we show that the backward Euler method maintains almost surely exponential stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Positive results are derived concerning the long time dynamics of fixed step size numerical simulations of stochastic differential equation systems with Markovian switching. Euler–Maruyama and implicit theta-method discretisations are shown to capture exponentialmean-square stability for all sufficiently small time-steps under appropriate conditions. Moreover, the decay rate, as measured by the second momentLyapunov exponent, can be reproduced arbitrarily accurately.Newfinite-time convergence results are derived as an intermediate step in this analysis.We also show, however, that the mean-square A-stability of the theta method does not carry through to this switching scenario. The proof techniques are quite general and hence have the potential to be applied to other numerical methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Many stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in the literature have a superlinearly growing nonlinearity in their drift or diffusion coefficient. Unfortunately, moments of the computationally efficient Euler-Maruyama approximation method diverge for these SDEs in finite time. This article develops a general theory based on rare events for studying integrability properties such as moment bounds for discrete-time stochastic processes. Using this approach, we establish moment bounds for fully and partially drift-implicit Euler methods and for a class of new explicit approximation methods which require only a few more arithmetical operations than the Euler-Maruyama method. These moment bounds are then used to prove strong convergence of the proposed schemes. Finally, we illustrate our results for several SDEs from finance, physics, biology and chemistry.},

The proposed algorithm, GCMC/BD, allows the simulation of ion channels with a realistic implementation of boundary conditions of concentration and transmembrane potential. The method is consistent with a statistical mechanical formulation of the equilibrium properties of ion channels (; Biophys. J. 77:139-153). The GCMC/BD algorithm is illustrated with simulations of simple test systems and of the OmpF porin of Escherichia coli. The approach provides a framework for simulating ion permeation in the context of detailed microscopic models.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerical integration of stochastic differential equations is commonly used in many branches of science. In this paper we present how to accelerate this kind of numerical calculations with popular NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units using the CUDA programming environment. We address general aspects of numerical programming on stream processors and illustrate them by two examples: the noisy phase dynamics in a Josephson junction and the noisy Kuramoto model. In presented cases the measured speedup can be as high as 675x compared to a typical CPU, which corresponds to several billion integration steps per second. This means that calculations which took weeks can now be completed in less than one hour. This brings stochastic simulation to a completely new level, opening for research a whole new range of problems which can now be solved interactively.},

  Abstract                 = {The solution of a parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) driven by an infinite-dimensional Brownian motion is in general not a semi-martingale anymore and does in general not satisfy an It$\backslash$\^{}\{o\} formula like the solution of a finite-dimensional stochastic ordinary differential equation (SODE). In particular, it is not possible to derive stochastic Taylor expansions as for the solution of a SODE using an iterated application of the It$\backslash$\^{}\{o\} formula. Consequently, until recently, only low order numerical approximation results for such a SPDE have been available. Here, the fact that the solution of a SPDE driven by additive noise can be interpreted in the mild sense with integrals involving the exponential of the dominant linear operator in the SPDE provides an alternative approach for deriving stochastic Taylor expansions for the solution of such a SPDE. Essentially, the exponential factor has a mollifying effect and ensures that all integrals take values in the Hilbert space under consideration. The iteration of such integrals allows us to derive stochastic Taylor expansions of arbitrarily high order, which are robust in the sense that they also hold for other types of driving noise processes such as fractional Brownian motion. Combinatorial concepts of trees and woods provide a compact formulation of the Taylor expansions.},

  Abstract                 = {Many stochastic differential equations that occur in financial modelling do not satisfy the standard assumptions made in convergence proofs of numerical schemes that are given in textbooks, i.e., their coefficients and the corresponding derivatives appearing in the proofs are not uniformly bounded and hence, in particular, not globally Lipschitz. Specific examples are the Heston and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models with square root coefficients and the Ait-Sahalia model with rational coefficient functions. Simple examples show that, for example, the Euler-Maruyama scheme may not converge either in the strong or weak sense when the standard assumptions do not hold. Nevertheless, new convergence results have been obtained recently for many such models in financial mathematics. These are reviewed here. Although weak convergence is of traditional importance in financial mathematics with its emphasis on expectations of functionals of the solutions, strong convergence plays a crucial role in Multi Level Monte Carlo methods, so it and also pathwise convergence will be considered along with methods which preserve the positivity of the solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations has intensified over the past decade. The earliest methods were usually heuristic adaptations of deterministic methods, but were found to have limited accuracy regardless of the order of the original scheme. A stochastic counterpart of the Taylor formula now provides a framework for the systematic investigation of numerical methods for stochastic differential equations. It suggests numerical schemes, which involve multiple stochastic integrals, of higher order of convergence. We shall survey the literature on these and on the earlier schemes in this paper. Our discussion will focus on diffusion processes, but we shall also indicate the extensions needed to handle processes with jump components. In particular, we shall classify the schemes according to strong or weak convergence criteria, depending on whether the approximation of the sample paths or of the probability distribution is of main interest.},

The first of these, extending an idea of Iverson, is the notation "[P]" for the function which is 1 when the Boolean condition P is true and 0 otherwise. This notation can encourage and clarify the use of characteristic functions and Kronecker deltas in sums and integrals. The second notation puts Stirling numbers on the same footing as binomial coefficients. Since binomial coefficients are written on two lines in parentheses and read "n choose k", Stirling numbers of the first kind should be written on two lines in brackets and read "n cycle k", while Stirling numbers of the second kind should be written in braces and read "n subset k". (I might say "n partition k".) The written form was first suggested by Imanuel Marx. The virtues of this notation are that Stirling partition numbers frequently appear in combinatorics, and that it more clearly presents functional relations similar to those satisfied by binomial coefficients.},

In addition, the lengths of the edges of the cubes with respect to which averaging is taken form an infinite decreasing geometric progression. The series obtained in this way converge almost everywhere in R . If the function expanded belongs to the Lebesgue space Lp on a compact set of l:t \~{} for some 1 \_< p < oo, then the expansion converges also in the norm of this space.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider two ways to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient of interacting Brownian particles. The first approach is based on the calculation of the mean square displacement of a Brownian particle starting from the Smoluchowski equation. In the second approach the self-diffusion coefficient is obtained as the product of the thermodynamic driving force and the mobility. The advantages and limitations of the two methods are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The explicit solution of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be found only in a few cases. Therefore, there is a need for accurate numerical approximations that could, for example, enable Monte Carlo Simulations. Convergence and sta- bility of these methods are well understood for SDEs with Lipschitz continuous coefficients. Our research focuses on those situations where the coefficients of the underlying SDEs are non-Lipschitzian. It was demonstrated in the literature, (Hutzenthaler and Jentzen 2009; Higham, Mao, and Yuan 2008) that in this case using the classical methods we may fail to obtain numerically computed paths that are accurate for small step-sizes, or to obtain qualitative information about the behaviour of numerical methods over long time intervals. This work addresses both of these issues, giving a customized analysis of the most widely used numer- ical methods. Motivated by existing work (Higham, Mao, and Stuart 2003b) and (Hu 1996) we consider implicit schemes. These authors have demonstrated that a backward Euler-Maruyama method strongly converges to the solution of SDEs with one-sided Lipschitz drift and linear growth diffusion coefficients. We extend their work by allowing for a polynomially growing diffusion term. The strong convergence is valuable as it reveals a pathwise error; new efficient Multi-Level Monte Carlo simulations (Giles 2008; Pages 2007) rely on strong convergence and weak convergence. In addition we examine global almost sure asymptotic stabil- ity in this nonlinear setting. In particular, we present a stochastic counterpart of the discrete LaSalle principle from which we deduce stability properties of im- plicit numerical methods. We also show that an appropriate implicit numerical method preserves positivity. In addition to being a desirable modelling property, in some cases positivity of the numerical approximation is required in order for the scheme to be well defined. Motivation for our work comes from finance and biology where many widely applied models do not satisfy a Lipschitz condition. We support our theoreti- cal results with relevant examples, such as stochastic interest rate models and stochastic volatility models. Although the considered schemes are implicit we point out that in many practical situations they do not increase computational complexity. We provide numerical results in support of our analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {tions at a single point. We provide the exact rate of convergence of the mini- mal errors that can be achieved by arbitrary (in a measurable way) on a finite number of sequential observations of the driving Brownian motion. The resulting lower error bounds hold in particu- lar for all methods that are implementable on a computer and use a random number generator to simulate the driving Brownian motion at finitely many points. Our analysis shows that approximation at a single point is strongly connected to an integration problem for the driving Brownian motion with a random weight. Exploiting general ideas from estimation of weighted inte- grals of stochastic processes, we introduce an adaptive scheme, which is easy to implement and performs asymptotically optimally. We study pathwise approximation of scalar stochastic differential equa- numerical methods that are based},

  Abstract                 = {We analyze numerical methods for the pathwise approximation of a sys- tem of stochastic differential equations. As a measure of performance we consider the qth mean of the maximum distance between the solution and its approximation on the whole unit interval. We introduce an adaptive dis- cretization that takes into account the local smoothness of every trajectory of the solution. The resulting adaptive Euler approximation performs asymptot- ically optimal in the class of all numerical methods that are based on a finite number of observations of the driving Brownian motion},

  Abstract                 = {Our aim is to study under what conditions the exact and numerical solution (based on equidistant nonrandom partitions of integration time-intervals) to a stochastic differential delay equation (SDDE) share the property of mean-square exponential stability. Our approach is trying to avoid the use of Lyapunov functions or functionals.We show that under a global Lipschitz assumption an SDDE is exponentially stable in mean square if and only if for some sufficiently small stepsizethe Euler–Maruyama (EM) method is exponentially stable in mean square. We then replace the global Lipschitz condition with a finite-time convergence condition and establish the same “if and only if” result. The important feature of this result is that it transfers the asymptotic problem into a finite-time convergence problem. Replacing the exact andEMnumerical solution with stochastic processes, we also discuss whether a family of stochastic processes share the stability property. This new approach allows us to discuss (i) whether a family of SDDEs share the stability property, and (ii) whether an SDDE with variable time lag shares stability property with the modifiedEMmethod. As another application of this general approach we consider a linear SDDE with variable time lag and establish an “if and only if” result. It should also be mentioned that the questions addressed, results proved, as well as style of analysis borrow heavily from [14] but the computations involved to cope with time delay are nontrivial},

On the basis of such an approach, for one-dimensional and multidimensional semi- linear transport equations of quite a general form with given initial data and boundary conditions the exact difference schemes (EDSs) are constructed. In the case of constant coefficients, such numerical methods can be created on rectangular grids, while in the case of variable coefficients – on moving grids only. The questions of developing differ- ence schemes of arbitrary order for quasi-linear transport equations with a nonlinear right-hand side are discussed. In this paper, the EDSs are constructed also for certain classes of linear and quasi- linear parabolic equations, for convection-diffusion problems with a small parameter, as well as inhomogeneous wave equations with constant coefficient},

The pathwise distance between the solution and its approximation is measured globally on the unit interval in the LO,,-norm, and we study the expectation of this distance. For systems with additive noise we obtain sharp lower and upper bounds for the minimal error in the class of arbitrary methods which use discrete observations of a Brownian path. The optimal order is achieved by an Euler scheme with adaptive step- size control. We illustrate the superiority of the adaptive method compared to equidistant discretization by a simulation experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe in detail how to implement a coarse-grained hybrid Molecular Dynamics and Stochastic Rotation Dynamics simulation technique that captures the combined effects of Brownian and hydrodynamic forces in colloidal suspensions. The importance of carefully tuning the simulation parameters to correctly resolve the multiple time and length-scales of this problem is emphasized. We systematically analyze how our coarse-graining scheme resolves dimensionless hydrodynamic numbers such as the Reynolds number, the Schmidt number, the Mach number, the Knudsen number, and the Peclet number. The many Brownian and hydrodynamic time-scales can be telescoped together to maximize computational efficiency while still correctly resolving the physically relevant physical processes. We also show how to control a number of numerical artifacts, such as finite size effects and solvent induced attractive depletion interactions. When all these considerations are properly taken into account, the measured colloidal velocity auto-correlation functions and related self diffusion and friction coefficients compare quantitatively with theoretical calculations. By contrast, these calculations demonstrate that, notwithstanding its seductive simplicity, the basic Langevin equation does a remarkably poor job of capturing the decay rate of the velocity auto-correlation function in the colloidal regime, strongly underestimating it at short times and strongly overestimating it at long times. Finally, we discuss in detail how to map the parameters of our method onto physical systems, and from this extract more general lessons that may be relevant for other coarse-graining schemes such as Lattice Boltzmann or Dissipative Particle Dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {When simulating discrete time approximations of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), numerical stability is clearly more important than numerical efficiency or some higher order of convergence.

  Abstract                 = {When simulating discrete time approximations of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), numerical stability is clearly more important than numerical efficiency or some higher order of convergence. Discrete time approximations of solutions of SDEs are widely used in simulations in finance and other areas of application. The stability criterion presented is designed to handle both scenario simulation and Monte Carlo simulation, that is, strong and weak simulation methods. The symmetric predictor-corrector Euler method is shown to have the potential to overcome some of the numerical instabilities that may be experienced when using the explicit Euler method. This is of particular importance in finance, where martingale dynamics arise for solutions of SDEs and diffusion coefficients are often of multiplicative type.

It is based on estimating the pth mean of local errors. The strategy leads to stepsize sequences that are identical for all computed paths. For the family of Euler schemes for SDEs with small noise, we derive computable estimates for the dominating term of the pth mean of local errors and show that the strategy becomes efficient for reasonable stepsizes. Numerical experience is reported for test examples including scalar SDEs and a stochastic circuit model.},

  Abstract                 = {The present paper introduces a new diffusion process for the purpose of modelling logistic-type behaviour patterns. Unlike other processes in the same context, this one verifies that its mean function is a logistic curve. In addition, its transition density can be found explicitly, which allows to analyse inference from the discrete sampling of trajectories. The main features of the process will be analysed and the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters will be carried out through discrete sampling. Regarding the numerical problems found to solve the likelihood equations, several strategies are developed for obtaining initial solutions for the usual numerical procedures. Such strategies are compared by means of a simulation example. Also, another simulation study is carried out in order to compare the estimation in this process to that developed by means of continuous sampling in the logistic diffusion model considered by Giovanis and Skiadas (1999). Finally an example is given for the growth of a microorganism culture. This example illustrates the predictive possibilities of the new process, as well as its ability to study time variables formulated as first-passage-times.},

We studied it, however, only for scalar SDEs because of difficulty and complexity in SDE systems.

  Abstract                 = {This paper focuses on the temporal discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and on different resulting numerical integration schemes. Using a method based on the exponentiation of time dependent operators, we carefully derive a numerical scheme for the Langevin dynamics, which we found equivalent to the proposal of Ermak and Buckholtz [J. Comput. Phys. 35, 169 (1980)] and not simply to the stochastic version of the velocity-Verlet algorithm. However, we checked on numerical simulations that both algorithms give similar results, and share the same "weak order two" accuracy. We then apply the same strategy to derive and test two numerical schemes for the dissipative particle dynamics. The first one of them was found to compare well, in terms of speed and accuracy, with the best currently available algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Pathological tremors exhibit a nonlinear oscillation that is not strictly periodic. We investigate whether the deviation from periodicity is due to nonlinear deterministic chaotic dynamics or due to nonlinear stochastic dynamics. To do so, we apply various methods from linear and nonlinear time series analysis to tremor time series. The results of the different methods suggest that the considered types of pathological tremors represent nonlinear stochastic second order processes. Finally, we evaluate whether two earlier proposed features capturing nonlinear effects in the time series allow for a discrimination between two pathological forms of tremor for a much larger sample of time series than previously investigated.

  Abstract                 = {A simple stochastic mathematical model is developed and investigated for early human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) population dynamics. The model, which is a multi-dimensional diffusion process, includes activated uninfected CD4(+)T cells, latently and actively infected CD4(+)T cells and free virions occurring in plasma. Stochastic effects are assumed to arise in the process of infection of CD4(+)T cells and transitions may occur from uninfected to latently or actively infected cells by chance mechanisms. Using the best currently available parameter values, the intrinsic variability in response to a given initial infection is examined by solving the stochastic system numerically. We estimate the statistical distributions of the time of occurrence and the magnitude of the early peak in viral concentration. The maximum of the viral load has a value in the experimental range and its time of occurrence has a 95\% confidence interval from 19.4 to 25.1 days. The stochastic nature of the growth of viral density is extremely pronounced in the first few days after initial infection. Threshold effects are noted at virion levels of about 3-5x10(-5) mm-3. In addition to modeling the intrinsic variability in HIV-1 growth, we have explored the effects of perturbations in the parameter values in order to assess the additional stochastic effects of between-patient variability. We found that changes in the initial number of virions or dose size, the rate at which latently infected CD4(+)T cells are converted to the actively infected form and the fraction of latent cells has only minor effects on the size, speed and variability of the response. In contrast, decreased speed and magnitude but greater variability in response were obtained when the death rate of uninfected CD4(+) T cells, the death rate of actively infected cells and the clearance rate of the virus were increased or when the appearance rate of uninfected CD4(+)T cells, the number of virions produced by infected cells, the infection rate of CD4(+)T cells and the initial number of uninfected activated CD4(+)T cells were decreased. We also determined the distribution of the time to reach a given virion density. From this distribution the probability of detection of the virus as a function of time can be estimated. The numerical results obtained are in the range of experimental values and are discussed in relation to recently proposed detection and testing procedures.},

Monolayers of paramagnetic polystyrene spheres confined to an air/water interface are studied using digital videomicroscopy.
