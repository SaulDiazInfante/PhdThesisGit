%	Applications of Monte Carlo type simulations \cite{Glasserman2004,Giles2008} as  Brownian Dynamics \cite{Cruz2012}
%require  fast numerical methods with low computational cost --- excluding the use of 
%implicit schemes in the majority of cases.
%The EM method is the most popular in such  
%simulations due to its simple algebraic structure, cheap computational cost and acceptable convergence rate 
%under global Lipschitz conditions. 
%However, if the drift or diffusion coefficient of stochastic 
%differential equation  is super-linear, then the EM approximation 
%diverges  in the mean square sense \cite{Hutzenthaler2009, Hutzenthaler2012b}. 
%In most applications, the coefficients of the stochastic  models in finances, biology or physics 
%have locally Lipschitz coefficients with super-linear growth. 
%Therefore, recent research has been focused on modifying the EM method to obtain strong convergence  under these 
%conditions keeping its simple structure and  its low computational cost. In the last years, 
%several methods have been developed in this direction:  the family of  Tamed schemes
%\cite{Hutzenthaler2012a, Wang2011, Zong2014,Hutzenthaler2015,Sabanis2015}, 
%a special type of balanced method \cite{Tretyakov2013},  the stopped scheme \cite{Liu2013a} and 
%a truncated Euler method  \cite{Mao2015}.
%In these works, the strong convergence of the proposed method
%is proved using the theory developed by Higham, Stuart and 
%Mao in \cite{Higham2002b} or by means of  the new approach given by  Hutzenthaler and Jentzen in 
%\cite{Hutzenthaler2015}.
%Both techniques obtain the property of  strong convergence by proving boundedness moments of the numerical and 
%analytical solution of the underlying SDE. In spite of the recent work in this subject,  it is still necessary
%to get more accurate numerical methods for SDE under super-linear growth and 
%non-globally Lipschitz coefficients.

	In this chapter, we develop an explicit method based on a linear version  of the Steklov method proposed 
in  \Cref{ch:Chapter3}. We consider the vector It\^o stochastic differential equation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:SDE1}
	dy(t)
	 =f(y(t))dt + g(y(t))dW(t), \quad 0\leq t\leq T,
	\quad y(0)=y_0,
\end{equation}
where $(f^{(1)},\dots, f^{(d)}):\R^d \to \R^d$ is one sided Lipschitz and 
$g = (g^{(j,i)})_{j\in \{1,\dots,d\}, i\in\{1,\dots, m\}}:\R^d \to \R^{d\times m}$ is global Lipschitz. 
Also we assume 
that  each component function $f^{(j)}$  can be written of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:AlternativeConstruction}
	f^{(j)}(x) = a_j(x) x^{(j)} + b_j (x^{(-j)}), 
\end{equation}
where $a_j$ and	$b_{j}$ are two scalar 	functions in  $\R^d$ 
and $x^{(-j)} = \left( x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(j-1)},x^{(j+1)},\dots x^{(d)}\right)$.%
